      "Dear Neeraj, may I know the basis of you saying that \"His views on topics like gender, sexuality, and mental health are highly regressive and unscientific!!\"?? A research scholar stating facts without actually checking the facts/reading already published research papers is usually unexpected! So, let me tell you a few studies on The Art of Living organization and the techniques taught by them! There was a study by YALE in which they showed how the SKY technique scientifically helped in reducing stress, anxiety & depression! A Study by AIIMS showed how SKY technique helped in curing Cancer patients. So much more research has already been done on how the techniques taught by them have helped 500+millions lives across 180 countries!  These programs are conducted for Scientists in NASA, are conducted regularly in IISC, many NITs, IITs, several institutes of Kota, Delhi & Chandigarh! \n",

If not, then it should not have been forwarded as recieved from an official account. I think the matter is now being handled immaturely and out of rage. \n",

      "1/4/23, 00:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Depends on your priorities. How much time can you spend on learning? Learning and improving is a life long process. And the question is if you should\n",

      "1/4/23, 00:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It doesn't usually do that 😂\n",
      "1/4/23, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because of noise\n",
      "1/4/23, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: AI works on data\n",
      "1/4/23, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If the data you give has few outliers (cases when something is amiss or is really bad about the market) it'll most likely ignore it\n",
      "1/4/23, 00:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You can ask it to give more weights to those outliers\n",
      "1/4/23, 00:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But then it'll become overly cautious, won't take risks\n",
      "1/4/23, 00:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's a big issue with these algorithms\n",

      "1/4/23, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's learning something to be able to solve your problem of fit your data to it's categories. You often can't make sense of the weights\n",

      "1/4/23, 01:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Good question. I want to, but how. They don't seem to be taking members by an open process. I don't want to comment much on that. I didn't apply before because I wasn't sure\n",

      "2/25/23, 12:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: a showpiece?\n",
      "2/25/23, 12:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Every plan should involve rescue, rehabilitation and release. Otherwise it's not a good plan\n",

       " 'Amritanshu Raj CR: CONCLUSION\\nThere is no doubt that Indian cinema is a critical and integral part\\nof Indian culture but It must be a tool for reform and not a tool to\\npush rhetoric and biases into the minds of millions of innocent\\npeople. Entertainment must not be used as a means to marginalise\\nwomen. The role and concept of a hero can be gender neutral if we\\nall show some broad mindedness. There is no need of portraying\\nthe hero as a masculine beacon. Hero can be anyone irrespective\\nof their gender. The qualities of heroes must be independent of\\ngender identity. Showing dominant masculine heroes is equivalent\\nto promoting patriarchy which has hindered the development and\\nintegration of women in the mainstream world for centuries. The\\nmovies which portray women as central characters could be a\\ngood way to overcome this current trend of masculine heroes. But\\nthe best possible solution of this issue could be the self awareness\\nof the audience i.e informed citizens build an empowered society.\\n',\n",
