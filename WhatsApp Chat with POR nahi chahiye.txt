Also if you're active you can add this in your CV too.🌝 You'll meet new people and prolly get to know some gossips too...

4/26/22, 20:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Some will even come up with fake medical reasons
4/26/22, 20:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's why I feel I don't stand a chance 🥲
4/26/22, 20:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: They gave phi values to use directly 🥲
4/26/22, 20:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I admit that the questions were easy and j could have even scored full marks had I learnt everything properly
4/26/22, 20:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I didn't know what exactly to do with them 🥲
4/26/22, 20:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *how to use them
4/26/22, 20:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was stuck after the normal part 🥲
4/26/22, 20:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: hmm
4/26/22, 20:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I knew about this CLT because of a project on statistical probability I did in school, recycled knowledge. I didn't learn it from here 🥲

4/26/22, 20:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ++
4/26/22, 20:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We have 2 assignment deadlines on 2nd may. Which I don't appreciate 🥲
4/26/22, 20:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: One is language, which is fine since this is the term paper
4/26/22, 20:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But the other is discrete maths, he hasn't corrected a single of our previous assignments. We don't even know if the stuff we wrote is correct. No feedback 🥲
4/26/22, 20:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I know it from our surveying course as we have to approximate %error in the values using bell's curve

5/7/22, 23:55 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I will once the deadline crosses 🤣  then read this conclusion
5/7/22, 23:55 - Amritanshu Raj CR: CONCLUSION
There is no doubt that Indian cinema is a critical and integral part
of Indian culture but It must be a tool for reform and not a tool to
push rhetoric and biases into the minds of millions of innocent
people. Entertainment must not be used as a means to marginalise
women. The role and concept of a hero can be gender neutral if we
all show some broad mindedness. There is no need of portraying
the hero as a masculine beacon. Hero can be anyone irrespective
of their gender. The qualities of heroes must be independent of
gender identity. Showing dominant masculine heroes is equivalent
to promoting patriarchy which has hindered the development and
integration of women in the mainstream world for centuries. The
movies which portray women as central characters could be a
good way to overcome this current trend of masculine heroes. But
the best possible solution of this issue could be the self awareness
of the audience i.e informed citizens build an empowered society.

5/8/22, 09:55 - Lekshmi R Nair: That he wanted to meet him privately
5/8/22, 09:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Let it go, be patient once his academics starts crashing on him, he will not interfere much
5/8/22, 09:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh, this is not good

5/8/22, 09:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: He is mech. And as far as ik, they don't have many courses🥲

5/8/22, 10:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Ask him politely to give more autonomy in next meeting and ask some club heads to support the idea
5/8/22, 10:03 - Saamp🐍: I started that

5/8/22, 10:03 - Saamp🐍: and I be like this is just one regular cultural council meeting
5/8/22, 10:04 - Saamp🐍: meanwhile I might've insulted current EBSB head few times
5/8/22, 10:04 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂🤭
5/8/22, 10:04 - Saamp🐍: and Sai Prakash also
5/8/22, 10:04 - Saamp🐍: that was one hell of a meeting
5/8/22, 10:04 - Saamp🐍: And I still don't get it why Bioscope head was not there

5/8/22, 10:05 - Saamp🐍: Are they friends ~with benefits~
5/8/22, 10:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yeah, create some consensus with club heads before as let them feel how their autonomy is curbed
5/8/22, 10:07 - Saamp🐍: Almost none of them know How A actual club works so most of them think we are making a big deal out of it and also Sai Prakash spoon feed them and tell them what to do so they're like yeah he's good he
5/8/22, 10:07 - Saamp🐍: he's doing something
5/8/22, 10:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Stop this, this isn't necessary 🥲, try to be polite as much as possible
5/8/22, 10:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Who is he?
5/8/22, 10:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: No fun as it might create resentment in his mind towards you 2 guys 🥲
5/8/22, 10:10 - Saamp🐍: but one thing that I've learned from EBSB is that some people work too much in making things, in order organized and professional while where the real work is required they don't put that much effort or honestly people start hating them cause the environment is not so friendly. I have avoided so many things because the environment wasn't good
5/8/22, 10:11 - Saamp🐍: Some friend of Sai Prakash
5/8/22, 10:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 🥲, if all of them are willing to be working under this system, then switch to survival mode

5/20/22, 17:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 17:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Train stops aren't sufficient to have a local dish as you can't leave the station and on station it's almost the same menu (by vendors)
5/20/22, 17:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nice vegetables
5/20/22, 17:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Here you'll get some biryanis, same as given in the irctc stalls and restaurant

5/20/22, 17:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Or you could annoy your father by using some object to tickle his head from upper berth
5/20/22, 17:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I won't be responsible if he loses his patience
5/20/22, 17:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 17:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: why your suggestions smells like conspiracy to start violence ⚔️?
5/20/22, 17:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is something I do often 😂
5/20/22, 17:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's why my father always makes me sleep in lower berth on his lap
5/20/22, 17:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Otherwise I'll do something or the other to annoy him
5/20/22, 17:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Usually the train is empty, so no issues on others sitting there
5/20/22, 17:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 🙏

5/20/22, 17:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: don't try such thing when in car as they might drop you then and there in the wilderness of nowhere
5/20/22, 17:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nah, they won't 😶‍🌫
5/20/22, 17:45 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that's upto them not you 🤣
5/20/22, 17:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm their kid, why would my parents throw me out 🥺
5/20/22, 17:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: to teach a lesson i guess 🥲
5/20/22, 17:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There are easier ways to teach a lesson. 🥲 they could just tell me it's annoying 🥲
5/20/22, 17:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 17:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: But still such a lesson is more memorable
5/20/22, 17:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The outside world is more dangerous. What if they never find me again? 🥲

5/20/22, 17:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They don't even let me out of the house for no reason 😂🥲
5/20/22, 17:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm drifting away in space
5/20/22, 17:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's the emptiness of the universe now
5/20/22, 17:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The earth looks beautiful from here
5/20/22, 18:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: some rules aren't enforced but evolved. It might be like you always leave your house after telling them the reason so they continued asking
5/20/22, 18:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: wonderful 🤣
5/20/22, 18:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not really. Things are more complex 😶‍🌫️
5/20/22, 18:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Since I was young they have been scared that because people around me are malayalis, they may not like me and they may not act in by best interests
5/20/22, 18:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: I did
5/20/22, 18:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: @919188011081 I am not an expert on Malayalis but you are, I expect you to stand and defend your community against such racist remarks 🙃⚔️
5/20/22, 18:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ouch
5/20/22, 18:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 18:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: But I do understand their apprehensions
5/20/22, 18:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: We reached Aluva
5/20/22, 18:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: .
5/20/22, 18:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: They r in what is essentially a foreign land. I would judge the heck out of it and won't trust anyone easily.  So....
5/20/22, 18:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: *if I were in their shoes
5/20/22, 18:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 👍
5/20/22, 18:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Watch out for the airport
5/20/22, 18:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It glows really bright in the night
5/20/22, 18:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's a sight to see
5/20/22, 18:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True, I won't expect others coming to my native state to trust us either. Sometimes for survival, not trusting others is necessary. They maybe really friendly. But that 'what if' can't leave ones mind that easily
5/20/22, 18:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What if this happens?
5/20/22, 18:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What if that happens
5/20/22, 18:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There has to be a plan B for every situation
5/20/22, 18:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I understand that 🥲. frankly saying i even don't trust people in my home state as Bihar is one of the topmost states in crimes
5/20/22, 18:48 - Lekshmi R Nair: I lost both my seats
5/20/22, 18:48 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 18:48 - Lekshmi R Nair: Now sitting at random other seat
5/20/22, 18:48 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥺🥺🥺
5/20/22, 18:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: I either wanna sit with father,   or alone
5/20/22, 18:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥺🥺🥺
5/20/22, 18:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲
5/20/22, 18:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents are very distrustful of people from Bihar in general. They didn't let me fill any choice in IIT Patna 🥲
5/20/22, 18:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No offence intended, but that's their perception
5/20/22, 18:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: The train is very crowded.
5/20/22, 18:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: Better book seats @919447744790
5/20/22, 19:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: It is like that, poverty with frustration and corruption. It's more like African countries in HDIs , crimes ...
5/20/22, 19:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Train starts from Palakkad. So second class will be empty in Palakkad and we'll not leave our seats 🥲
5/20/22, 19:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And now there is little hope of booking
5/20/22, 19:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲
5/20/22, 19:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How is the state government there? Not in terms of the political party. But in terms of bringing a change
5/20/22, 19:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: there were changes in 2005-10 era. Now the government is ambition less and system is collapsing and have more virtual presence than on ground. liqueur ban has resulted in a stagnant judiciary as way too many cases of alcohol consumption
5/20/22, 19:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
5/20/22, 19:39 - Lekshmi R Nair: Me at piravam

5/20/22, 19:45 - Saamp🐍: 🥺🥺
5/20/22, 19:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What did she do? 😂
5/20/22, 19:45 - Saamp🐍: She's not running

5/20/22, 20:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No train has ever stopped there since the renovation
5/20/22, 20:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Plat4 is also show. Earlier a DEMU would start from there at 7am
5/20/22, 20:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Due to very few passengers, it was discontinued 🥲
5/20/22, 20:54 - Saamp🐍: Were you one of them?
5/20/22, 20:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>

5/20/22, 20:55 - Saamp🐍: Noiceee
5/20/22, 20:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Especially during the vacation, my mother would take me with her to work so that I don't wreck the house
5/20/22, 20:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 20:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: A nice kid I was
5/20/22, 20:56 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
5/20/22, 20:56 - Saamp🐍: Drilling holes in people's ceiling
5/20/22, 20:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But that was years back
5/20/22, 20:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sadly we are in ground floor this time 🥲
5/20/22, 20:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I could drill a hole through the wall of the Washing machine room
5/20/22, 20:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: Why
5/20/22, 20:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What do you say @919188011081
5/20/22, 20:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: Like why
5/20/22, 20:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: This is a really deep question
5/20/22, 20:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'll make Yukta sleep in my room today. And I'll get the work done somehow
5/20/22, 20:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why not?
5/20/22, 20:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is a deeper question
5/20/22, 20:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: A hole would be a shortcut to the washing machine room where just one machine works and the rest are out of order
5/20/22, 20:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It will be useful when you need to spy on people who set the machine on hygiene mode which takes over two hours
5/20/22, 20:59 - Saamp🐍: I used to put machine on the most largest program 😌
5/20/22, 20:59 - Saamp🐍: H4 wm sucks

5/24/22, 23:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: Let's see if it goes away
5/24/22, 23:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: How to see all installed programs
5/24/22, 23:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: List Installed Programs Using Settings. Press Windows key + I to open Settings and click Apps > Apps & features. Doing so will list all programs installed on your computer, along with the Windows Store apps that came pre-installed.
5/24/22, 23:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Works in windows 10
5/24/22, 23:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Do you have tour windows product key?
5/24/22, 23:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: Dunno
5/24/22, 23:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: Nothing is installed recently its shown
5/24/22, 23:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: Tbh install prompt wasn't actually shown
5/24/22, 23:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's only screen issue cuz video keeps on playing
5/24/22, 23:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
5/24/22, 23:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: Me uninstalled ubuntu

5/25/22, 16:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you akshar core team member + astronomy club excavation, revival + CPR providing committee member 👀
5/25/22, 16:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
5/25/22, 17:53 - Saamp🐍: +++++
5/25/22, 17:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm thinking of leaving astronomy club, at least not a core team member
5/25/22, 17:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: CPR provider where? 😂
5/25/22, 18:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh sed
5/25/22, 18:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: it needs cpr to be alive and working
5/25/22, 18:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
5/25/22, 18:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yearlong sunrise
5/25/22, 18:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😮
5/25/22, 18:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Really pretty
5/25/22, 18:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
5/25/22, 18:53 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1
5/25/22, 18:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Thing is, over the months my views on the direction of the club has changed and it conflicts with the initial sentiments we started on. I don't want the club to die, and I don't think Jayanth will let it die, but I can't continue on
5/25/22, 18:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: What happened?
5/25/22, 18:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nothing actually, and that gave me time to think...
5/25/22, 18:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Jayanth 3rd year?
5/25/22, 18:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I want a more engineering driven club. Rather than exploring the universal madness I would like to explore how space organizations from all over the world try to approach the universe. The equipment they use, what all have they learnt from the missions, etc...
5/25/22, 18:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes, tech sec. In fact he is holding a meeting with some still interested members about budget, club head, and everything else
5/25/22, 18:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's what I personally am interested in, not just learning about different things across the universe
5/25/22, 18:57 - Amritanshu Raj CR: your idea seems more rational, There approach will end up like choosing black in a dark room 👀
5/25/22, 18:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: too many topics and no end outcome
5/25/22, 19:08 - Saamp🐍: +1 your idea seems really good
5/25/22, 19:08 - Saamp🐍: Moreover more "useful"
5/25/22, 19:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True, that's why my views changed. The astronomy club docs currently envision a hobbyists' perspective but in the past few months I thought a lot about it and realized that it's not feasible in the long run. It struck hard when in Jan we had a meeting where it was decided that we'll take sessions. Intro session by Ayush and the next one by me. And I came to the conclusion that I can't make the session on just 'universe' interesting. What I can do is discuss about that engineering marvel that the Mars rover is. That's more in my forte
5/25/22, 19:30 - Lekshmi R Nair: They are saying they won't repay me from the refreshments
5/25/22, 19:30 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😒
5/25/22, 19:30 - Lekshmi R Nair: I wrote proposal and I got approval 4 it
5/25/22, 19:30 - Lekshmi R Nair: Y?

5/25/22, 19:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ehh, makes no sense

5/25/22, 19:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ₹80 can give us lots of dosas
5/25/22, 19:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: That themdi was joking
5/25/22, 19:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😒😒😒
5/25/22, 19:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Who is that? 😂
5/25/22, 19:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: Or he said so
5/25/22, 19:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: Dunno
5/25/22, 19:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: Sai Prakash
5/25/22, 19:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: Or he tried to scam me

5/25/22, 19:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Heard what?  👀
5/25/22, 19:39 - Lekshmi R Nair: You were given a particular topic?
5/25/22, 19:39 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ayush started, and stuff about it, from him I think?
5/25/22, 19:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No no, we were thinking of what the possible topics could be. They didn't interest me in particular
5/25/22, 19:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You could say that the things I said are also a part of our agenda, but they are there only because I put them there. Others didn't have any such ideas
5/25/22, 19:42 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ooo
5/25/22, 19:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Currently what I like is telescopes
5/25/22, 19:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's part of the plan. But it'll take timw
5/25/22, 19:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We'll need to accumulate quite a lot of money for that
5/25/22, 19:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And then learning to use it
5/25/22, 19:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ayush Singh, Sneha Bhattacharjee, Saiful Hasan, Mihir Dharap, Haripriya, Vishnu S R, Himanshu Kumar, Ravi Chaudhary.

5/25/22, 20:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: tell em if they want events to be hold in uncivilized manner. They should give you one more chance and you will prove them that you are equally capable of being uncivilized by keeping the chief guest hungry and thirsty
5/25/22, 20:34 - Lekshmi R Nair: He was joking 🌝
5/25/22, 20:34 - Lekshmi R Nair: 💸💸💸💸

5/28/22, 13:40 - Lekshmi R Nair: What is up with Myanmar rn? It has disappeared from news
5/28/22, 13:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Type of a civil war, military dictator is ready to negotiate with some powerful resistance groups. disappearance is mainly due to Ukraine conflict and also India and China both are silent, to protect their influence in the country
5/28/22, 13:43 - Lekshmi R Nair: Oo😵
5/28/22, 13:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: also Suu kyi (face of democratic resistance is under house arrest and have been convicted under various corruption charges), India is silent due to some anti-India grps operating in nort-east have bases in Myanmar and if we condemn their military, they might give free hand to those grps . Though Mizoram has took over several thousands of refugees escaping excesses of military crackdown
5/28/22, 13:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: also India secretly maintains good ties with atleast one of powerful resistance grps. That grp attacked an camp and killed several anti-India militants 3-4 months ago
5/28/22, 13:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ooo. You know so much stuff😲😲

5/28/22, 13:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You sound like a professional news reporter
5/28/22, 13:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: we have a project undergoing there (Sittwe port and land routes connecting it with north-east India) in order to connect the north-east with sea route. It is our priority right now, the port will be completed soon. The military rulers have pledged their allegiance to the complication of project. only problem is spillover of violence in Indian states but with peace deals oning with rebel grps and gov of India chances are very less expect some big external power encourage them to do so...
5/28/22, 13:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: nice
5/28/22, 13:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I just speculated
5/28/22, 14:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: themks

5/28/22, 17:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: Oooo. Y is it even there?
5/28/22, 17:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was supposed to reduce traffic. But it ate up space from the road and increased traffic. Not many use it for reasons unknown to me, but known to others 🥲
5/28/22, 20:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Is this the permanent case?
5/28/22, 20:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup
5/28/22, 20:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There is some reason why they don't use the flyover, maybe the direction is wrong, like it was a 4 way junction, they built the flyover on the wrong way. But that's just me speculating
5/28/22, 20:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Everytime we go that way, out taxi driver hurls abuses at that flyover 😂

5/28/22, 20:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
5/28/22, 20:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Civil engineers leave things to remember them by. For CS it's legacy code which will soon become outdated

5/29/22, 14:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The video you attached? Is there a simpler example? I feel this may intimidate some people
5/29/22, 14:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Or you have to mention something along the lines of "don't get intimidated"
5/29/22, 14:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😶‍🌫️
5/29/22, 14:27 - Saamp🐍: Dunno
5/29/22, 14:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1
5/29/22, 14:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not just some I find it intimidating 😂
5/29/22, 14:28 - Saamp🐍: I'll remove it
5/29/22, 14:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Let it be there. But make it clear it's an example solely to help them understand the format, not the language they have to use during the debate. You can be part of the debate even if you are a noob
5/29/22, 14:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
5/29/22, 14:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: copying logic from net(for debates) without much understanding of realpolitik ends up hurting own interest

5/30/22, 22:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: “Never predict the end of the world. You’re almost certain to be wrong, and if you’re right, no one will be around to congratulate you.”
5/30/22, 22:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True
5/30/22, 23:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
5/31/22, 09:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I predict that the world will end on 2nd December 2079
5/31/22, 10:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: No, it won't, a bet?
5/31/22, 10:16 - Saamp🐍: Honestly no one can confirm when the world ended
5/31/22, 10:16 - Saamp🐍: To confirm there has to be an observer
5/31/22, 10:16 - Saamp🐍: Similarly
5/31/22, 10:17 - Saamp🐍: No one can confirm if the world ended except the last existing observer
5/31/22, 10:17 - Saamp🐍: With induction
5/31/22, 10:17 - Saamp🐍: We can prove that
5/31/22, 10:17 - Saamp🐍: There can't be an observer who can confirm if the person left other than him/her is the last observer
5/31/22, 10:18 - Saamp🐍: Will end
5/31/22, 10:18 - Saamp🐍: One can write this in more formal and clear way
5/31/22, 10:19 - Saamp🐍: And we got the proof of wijrhrnc
5/31/22, 10:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1
5/31/22, 10:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Hmm, even if he confirms who will verify his claims
5/31/22, 10:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Accepted, I'll give you an ice cream worth Rs 30 in terms of today's monetary value if i lose
5/31/22, 10:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If I win I'll live on with the satisfaction that my prediction became true
5/31/22, 10:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Noice
5/31/22, 10:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: You may have your satisfaction, but how can you live if it ends then it ends for all?
5/31/22, 11:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That was sarcasm 😶‍🌫️

5/31/22, 15:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Assam(North-east) is near by golden triangle you can get much more than poppy
5/31/22, 15:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: The Golden Triangle includes parts of Burma, China, Laos, and Thailand. It provides ideal conditions for opium cultivation, which began during the 16th and 17th centuries.
5/31/22, 16:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You could say both
5/31/22, 16:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Some Chinese emperor saw what Opium did to china and tried to ban it, according to my weak memory

5/31/22, 21:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Dear all,
Greetings from the cultural council! 

Hope you are safe and doing well. The cultural council strongly believes that the feedback from the student community will help us along our journey and is in the interest of all of us. The council carries forward a vision of bringing back the glory of our institute's cultural activities, which were affected by the pandemic. The council is willing to help the students who are eager to learn and would like to take forward their interest and prowess in their interested domains. Thus, considering all these aspects, we are introducing an active feedback system that will be a running form till the end of our tenures and the students have the flexibility to let us know their feedback/ thoughts pertaining to the cultural council/activities/events at any point of time. The council will try its best to take it up and get back to you at the earliest.

Kindly note that the form will be available in each club's Whatsapp group's description and in the sac portal under the cultural section soon apart from this mail for convenient access.

We do believe in feedback and constructive criticism, however, we kindly request you to avoid any personal comments and put forward your feedback and concerns properly and constructively so as to maintain a healthy atmosphere.
5/31/22, 21:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What should I write for Akshar and Curtain call? 🤔
5/31/22, 21:52 - Lekshmi R Nair: If you have something to write, write only then
5/31/22, 21:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm not even in the club 😶‍🌫
5/31/22, 21:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
5/31/22, 21:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Will they check if this feedback was written by someone in the club?
5/31/22, 21:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also, am I in Akshar? 😶‍🌫
5/31/22, 21:54 - Saamp🐍: Yas
5/31/22, 21:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Direct promotion from a non member to core team 😂
5/31/22, 21:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nice
5/31/22, 21:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: since you already know club heads you can give feedback to them directly
5/31/22, 21:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't have anything to give 🥲
5/31/22, 22:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: then sit quietly and enjoy life.
5/31/22, 22:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
5/31/22, 22:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
5/31/22, 22:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why sit quiet when I can wreck havoc on someone else's life
5/31/22, 22:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: To be honest that is more preferred
5/31/22, 22:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Gadafi had similar thoughts
5/31/22, 22:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
5/31/22, 22:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: hmm
5/31/22, 22:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: added layer of bureaucracy, making life unnecessarily complicated
5/31/22, 22:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: It may be helpful for people afraid of offending?
5/31/22, 22:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: Dunno
5/31/22, 22:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True
5/31/22, 22:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: might be
5/31/22, 22:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If I want I can draft a very destructive feedback that seems constructive and you'll never get to know my name
5/31/22, 22:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I'm not the only one with such power
5/31/22, 22:34 - Lekshmi R Nair: That is so true
5/31/22, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Hopefully people will use the feedback form well
5/31/22, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've seen the responses of the SAC feedback form
5/31/22, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was anonymous and some of the comments were so thoughtless
5/31/22, 22:36 - Lekshmi R Nair: Like tbh I heard feedback about workshop like participation was poor without saying numbers. So outsiders may think its actually low. But, it was pretty high for such a scale workshop in holidays.
5/31/22, 22:36 - Lekshmi R Nair: So, they can give feedback that Sai Prakesh reads and be like, so true,  while it may nit be
5/31/22, 22:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup
5/31/22, 22:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's gonna happen
5/31/22, 22:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't let negative poorly researched comments bother you both @919499725866 and @919188011081
5/31/22, 22:37 - Lekshmi R Nair: I have you guys fir actual feedback . Right @919499725866
5/31/22, 22:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Workshop feedback none of us can give 🥲
5/31/22, 22:38 - Lekshmi R Nair: I send form
5/31/22, 22:38 - Lekshmi R Nair: But collect mail id
5/31/22, 22:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ask Haripriya and others you trust not to mince their words
5/31/22, 22:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Omk
5/31/22, 22:39 - Lekshmi R Nair: Got few responses, mostly it was nice, but maybe anonymous may help us get constructive criticism

6/3/22, 20:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 👀
6/3/22, 20:29 - Saamp🐍: Noice
6/3/22, 20:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: nope that's oddest
6/3/22, 20:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: hmm
6/3/22, 20:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Very odd
6/3/22, 21:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My father just shocked me with a family tree which even lists my 20th ancestor
6/3/22, 22:10 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😵
6/3/22, 22:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/3/22, 22:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: does he maintain the list on own or got from priest in Gaya (Panda). They have long list as our ancestors once in a lifetime went on pilgrimage
6/3/22, 23:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: I have seen it is history channel
6/3/22, 23:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: In
6/3/22, 23:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We maintain it on our own
6/3/22, 23:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Assuming a gap of 20 years between each successive birth, the most ancient ancestor must be born before or in the 1600s
6/3/22, 23:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲
6/3/22, 23:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's intimidating
6/3/22, 23:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We were initially in Bangladesh, so the Panda won't be having the list
6/4/22, 08:45 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Nice
6/4/22, 08:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: You should digitalise the records to protect them
6/4/22, 08:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Why? (It's more assuring that you know your ancestors)
6/4/22, 08:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh, migrated during independence?
6/4/22, 08:49 - Saamp🐍: Do you have an Adhaar card?😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
6/4/22, 10:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup, they are well protected according to my father 😂
6/4/22, 10:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes 😶‍🌫️
6/4/22, 10:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Much before actually
6/4/22, 10:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes, true, but so many ancestors 😶‍🌫️
6/4/22, 14:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: old school methods
6/4/22, 14:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oo
6/4/22, 14:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: logically each family will have same no of ancestors in the long run only that you there name
6/4/22, 14:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/4/22, 14:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: At some point of time there will be a common ancestor. We might be distantly related too
6/4/22, 14:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/4/22, 17:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: at some point of time our ancestors might be in battle against each other on food (millions of possiblities)
6/4/22, 19:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True
6/4/22, 19:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Our ancestors may have even murdered each other
6/4/22, 19:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: One thing I really liked about this place is that in all the clothing stores I went, the attendants are really helpful
6/4/22, 19:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Unlike what k experienced in some places in Kerala, they don't giggle that the small sizes aren't fitting me
6/4/22, 19:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They really tried to find the perfect pant for me. And I barely know any Assamese

6/4/22, 21:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Why is a physician held in much higher esteem than a statistician? A physician makes an analysis of a complex illness whereas a statistician makes you ill with a complex analysis!

6/4/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm going to eat. Will be back soon

6/8/22, 21:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: The current gov changing names related to the islamic rulers esp. mugals as they consider them invaders and barbarians (committing various crimes and oppressing non believers)  and not something to be idealized or worthy of respect in order to fetch some votes by polarization and to return to the "golden era" of India
6/8/22, 21:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 🤣
6/8/22, 21:24 - Saamp🐍: I forgot the name of the street
6/8/22, 21:24 - Saamp🐍: Wait

6/8/22, 21:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: then add it in a reform that was initiated around 449 years ago
6/8/22, 21:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Time travel is not in practice in the present
6/8/22, 21:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: just and enjoy, frankly saying what they are doing is right but their purpose is not necessarily right always (distraction)
6/8/22, 21:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥹
6/8/22, 21:45 - Amritanshu Raj CR: just list in a reform suggested then and it will be reformed (the bureaucratic way of solving problems)
6/8/22, 21:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The committee didn't exist back then
6/8/22, 21:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/8/22, 22:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: then how did a reform will take 450 yrs, reform must be less than lifetime
6/8/22, 22:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Reforms are to be done and implemented in the future, not the past

6/9/22, 11:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So many people begging for alms
6/9/22, 11:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's almost as if they'll attack us
6/9/22, 12:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 🥲
6/9/22, 12:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We bought a whole box of coins and they were jumping 🥲
6/9/22, 12:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I got scared and gave the box to my mother
6/10/22, 08:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh, mainly they don't bother locals

6/10/22, 10:25 - Lekshmi R Nair: https://youtu.be/Dum0bqWfiGw
I found this video.  I was interested in the guy who this video is talking about since last few days I encountered his videos that were very well informed.  But then, this video also raises fair points. @919205513216 are u familiar with the guy this video is about?
6/10/22, 13:40 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i have seen the videos of the guy who is getting criticized (on vox channel). The video is about how his unconventional journalism is promoting the same narratives he once stood against, atleast he pretended to be. He talks about stake holder capitalism which talks about the csr and other value based things but he is promoting wef which itself is one of strongest promoter of a new form capitalism which focuses only on creating profits but pretends to vocal on other issues in order to look good
6/10/22, 13:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Bihar: an overpopulated undisciplined state running low on ethical values 🥲
6/10/22, 13:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: even sewage flows more on roads than drainage systems
6/10/22, 13:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I used to watch the aforementioned person's videos while he was in Vox. Haven't watched his videos since he  became an independent creator
6/10/22, 13:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/10/22, 14:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The roads except for the highways are bad 🥲
6/10/22, 14:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sitting in the auto for 45 minutes almost spilled my guts
6/10/22, 18:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You know, when we were going to Gaya from Allahabad/Prayagraj, some dangerous people got in from Mughalsarai, some pandit jis in a huge group. They were also going to Gaya and were behaving as if they owned the train and we all had captured their seats. They moved my father away from their seat, even though there was space for them to sit too (father's seat was in another block of the same compartment). After settling down with the enormous amounts of luggage jn their possession, they proceeded to insult every aspect of 'modernism', the fact that my brother was listening to music using earphones, that I was wearing pants, that women now eat with men, that my mother referred to my father by 'name', something women shouldn't do 😶‍🌫
6/10/22, 18:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm bored, so ignore if it sounds random 😂
6/10/22, 18:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We also found them in a temple in Gaya and ran away before they could recognize us 😶‍🌫

6/10/22, 18:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oo
6/10/22, 18:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1
6/10/22, 18:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh 🥲
6/10/22, 18:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: ac/ non ac?
6/10/22, 18:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: People(locals) usually shrub them off and not leave sits. Dealing them equally rudely as they behave 🤐.
6/10/22, 18:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh 🥲
6/10/22, 19:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Humsafar express, whole train is AC 🥲
My father usually avoids this train because everyone enters the AC compartment. But this time was unavoidable
6/10/22, 19:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh 🥲
We are calmer people 🥲
We kept quiet for the most part
6/10/22, 19:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We would have died in non AC with the heat 🥲
6/11/22, 07:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: Wtf 🙄
6/11/22, 07:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: Hiw jobless can people be🤔

6/11/22, 08:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/11/22, 08:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Pretty much want to announce their opinions on everything 😂
6/11/22, 08:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was hilarious to hear them talking. I couldn't stop my giggling. Everyone else in the compartment began gossiping on them once they left 😂
6/11/22, 08:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They made that 1 hour of our trip miserable
6/11/22, 08:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/11/22, 09:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I just watched the video in question. Now I want to watch some of his other videos to compare 😶‍🌫
6/11/22, 09:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh 🥲
6/11/22, 09:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you keep quiet, you get oppressed 🥲
6/11/22, 09:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 🥲
6/11/22, 09:29 - Lekshmi R Nair: I watched the china video, it's true. He completely moves away from topic. Which was confusing for me at the time. Also he started praising apple and all to be doing great things, and I was confused 🤔😂
6/11/22, 09:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1 that's the problem with this new form of journalism. They show and praise what they like +criticise what they don't like and not what people need to know
6/11/22, 09:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yeah. And it forms so many people's opinions on various things. If we basically watch one person for news, our ideas will be completely tilted to one side. Which is extremely dangerous unless u recognize it, and try to balance out ur views a bit. Which is hard in many cases.
6/11/22, 09:38 - Lekshmi R Nair: I liked his video discussing lab leak hypothesis.  Which I found very unusual, since western "liberal" reporters refused to report on it. But then I saw more of his videos, which seem extremely well reported,  but dubious in some aspects. Then I have to wonder, what all he said is true, or just his opinion.
6/11/22, 09:40 - Lekshmi R Nair: A trend that I seemed to notice in a lot of US based informative channels is they gloss over US s contributions in creating wars. Everywhere. But this guy did talk about that, which was interesting.
6/11/22, 09:40 - Lekshmi R Nair: Most of wester world gloss over their contributions in war, except maybe Germany,  cuz uk,  they can't just say, oops
6/11/22, 09:40 - Lekshmi R Nair: Western

6/11/22, 10:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Have you watched the movie Jojo Rabbit?
6/11/22, 10:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yesss
6/11/22, 10:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's satire, everyone may not like it
6/11/22, 10:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I loved it. Gives us a glimpse into the madness but is serious when needed
6/11/22, 10:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: I watched it. Liked it. It was funny sad and interesting
6/11/22, 10:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/11/22, 10:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ++
6/11/22, 10:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I watched it during the vacation using Nikhitha's prime account, the day before I left
6/11/22, 10:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I watched it at 1 in the night 😶‍🌫
6/11/22, 10:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/11/22, 10:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: It showed how stupid so called rules can be that dictators impose. The hail Hitler scene😶‍🌫
6/11/22, 10:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I would like to watch it again someday
6/11/22, 10:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ++
6/11/22, 10:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I felt so bad when the girl had to Hail Hitler to so many people
6/11/22, 10:52 - Lekshmi R Nair: And how, if we are nit personally acquainted to the people,  its easier to see them as monsters and not as human beings
6/11/22, 10:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ++
6/11/22, 10:52 - Lekshmi R Nair: That scene was scary.
6/11/22, 10:52 - Lekshmi R Nair: But funny too😂
6/11/22, 10:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My heart stopped beating when she was asked to show her papers
6/11/22, 10:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: So I wonder, how many of the people imposing atrocities were this brainwashed
6/11/22, 10:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: They didn't see it as wrong 🥲
6/11/22, 10:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True
6/11/22, 10:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: Cuz the jews were monsters to them🥲
6/11/22, 10:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: I want to see Schindlers list after hearing his story
6/11/22, 10:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They were just following orders. Their minds weren't theirs
6/11/22, 10:55 - Lekshmi R Nair: But can we remove the responsibility of crime they committed from their shoulders?
6/11/22, 10:55 - Lekshmi R Nair: Whatever it is, they still killed people just based on race🤔
6/11/22, 10:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup, and we don't have a way of knowing if they were in their right mind
6/11/22, 10:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: I wonder if the people Hitler hated were black or brown people, and killed them, wouldn't Europe pr US care as much?
6/11/22, 10:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: *Would
6/11/22, 10:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: Or
6/11/22, 10:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's difficult to differentiate opinions from facts 🥲
6/11/22, 10:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Good question 🤔
6/11/22, 10:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: Because in coverage of news about Ukraine, I hear,  this is not in Asia Africa or Latin America,  it's Europe.  
It's in Europe the war is on.
Its not a third world country.
6/11/22, 10:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: Blah blah
6/11/22, 10:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: They care so much cuz Europeans are killed
6/11/22, 10:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😶‍🌫😶‍🌫
6/11/22, 11:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: Atleast it sounds that way when news is reported
6/11/22, 11:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There is the story of Jesse Owens in the olympics
6/11/22, 11:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥹
6/11/22, 11:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ooo. I just looked it up. It's soo cool. And humiliating for Nazis😂
6/11/22, 11:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And sometimes when I want to learn about some topic, I stop myself if I don't have much time to look at various sources. Otherwise I'll look only at one side of things which can be dangerous
6/11/22, 11:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
6/11/22, 11:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Europe didn't responded due to genocide but because France was invaded and now threat was looming over imperial Britain
6/11/22, 11:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😶‍🌫nice people
6/11/22, 11:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep, those reports were like how white people can die
6/11/22, 11:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: in US's response there was this factor (genocide) but European countries barely cared about genocide even in their own countries treatment of jews was not very though it was not even as bad as in post ww1 Germany
6/11/22, 11:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
6/11/22, 11:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/11/22, 11:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: treatment of blacks was not very good in Germany but still it was comparable to other European states
6/11/22, 11:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: They were equally persecuted on both sides
6/11/22, 11:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Rules are stupid because dictators distance themselves from rationals due to influence of boot lickers in their close circle

6/12/22, 15:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: I saw a movie on this🤔
6/12/22, 15:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: Tom Hanks
6/12/22, 15:53 - Amritanshu Raj CR: They escaped at end, once USSR once lost it's cosmonaut and even he was told that they would not be able to rescue him. He was allowed talk to his family and the gov promised to look after the family after his death
6/12/22, 15:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh, I'll check it out someday
6/12/22, 15:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's really upsetting when that happens. And it'll probably happen again. And we'll learn more and more from such events
6/12/22, 15:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: These incidents test us, our capability of dealing with adverse situations. If we manage to successfully tackle it, lives are saved. If we fail, we lose some people along the way. But the knowledge and experiences gained shouldn't be lost. Those are key to managing a future crisis
6/12/22, 16:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but people keep information's declassified especially countries like China /USSR (socialists) in order to hide failures
6/12/22, 16:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: non related “If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.”

6/12/22, 16:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup, names don't have to be mentioned 😶‍🌫
6/12/22, 16:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And they are giants
6/12/22, 16:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://youtu.be/PriwCi6SzLo
I don't know if you've watched this before. But a year back I realized just how much money from the college goes into these subscriptions
6/12/22, 16:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I have watched it. intellectual property rights is a very heated issue. Sometimes the role of publishers becomes more of hoarders and profiteers than facilitators. Monopoly of trusted publishers is also an issue. Diminishing the role of publishers might solve the issue
6/12/22, 16:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not easy though 🥲

6/12/22, 21:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh must have been headache for him untill he would have learnt otherwise
6/12/22, 21:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Now old absolute methods are losing their value thanks to digital initiatives
6/12/22, 21:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Offline docs lead to a lot of corruption, bribery and red tape-ism
6/12/22, 21:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup. He made me write a few emails to the academic section
6/12/22, 21:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/12/22, 21:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But is our data safe?
6/12/22, 21:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What is red tape-ism? 🥲🤔
6/12/22, 21:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh, poor academic section 👀 🤣
6/12/22, 21:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: What makes you believe it was safe when it was offline
6/12/22, 21:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Bureaucratic delays which could be avoided
6/12/22, 21:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Like red tape symbolises inauguration ceremony previously even completed projects were opened for public untill some minister would inaugurate it by cutting red tape
6/12/22, 21:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: What do you guys think about tansgenders in women sports?
6/12/22, 22:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: And, @919499725866 how are you?
6/12/22, 22:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: *transgenders
6/12/22, 22:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: If India wining medals due to transgender athelete in an event then ok otherwise it's not ok
6/12/22, 22:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/12/22, 22:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂😂😂
6/12/22, 22:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: Noice policy
6/12/22, 22:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: America may win medals though🤔
6/12/22, 22:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: But they already do
6/12/22, 22:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: More medals ig
6/12/22, 22:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: If you think there has no serious research on whether trans people have physical superiority over women, if yes then medals should be given to them but other 3 should also get medals, if not then it's alright if they wanna participate in women's event
6/12/22, 22:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/12/22, 22:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Yep, haven't heard in a while
6/12/22, 22:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: I agree with ur first proposal.  Cuz as far as ik, there is no proper research done. But at the same time, what if they are athletes in their own right and then, just cuz they transition,  they don't get represented.  Conflicts.
There has been scandal about trans athlete, Lia Thomas,  who looks muscular,  and won over Olympic silver medalist while she was not even in top 100 of men's swimming a year ago, when she still identified as male.
6/12/22, 22:41 - Saamp🐍: Idk
6/12/22, 22:41 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/12/22, 22:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh, cases of flip-floping between gender identities in order to win should be dealt with disciplinary action.
6/12/22, 22:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: But the person may genuinely wanna be a female, winning is a plus. But isn't the win unfair
6/12/22, 22:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🤔
6/12/22, 22:53 - Amritanshu Raj CR: But she/he could have decided his/her identity before 1st international tournament? And if he did then he must continue it
6/12/22, 22:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: She didn't participate internationally. It was national I think
6/12/22, 22:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: USA
6/12/22, 22:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Sudden changes of heart can't be a basis of change in category
6/12/22, 22:55 - Lekshmi R Nair: I will show you a video. 2 videos. Both sides ig
6/12/22, 22:55 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Then was she above 18 and if yes and if she chooses her category under no external pressure
6/12/22, 22:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: She is above 18
6/12/22, 22:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: 21 in fact. 20 when she decided to be female.
6/12/22, 22:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Olympic qualifications are based upon international events ig

6/12/22, 23:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There are two Rajdhanis from Dibrugarh
6/12/22, 23:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We traveled in the other one a few days back and it had bedding, since it was under Delhi division
6/12/22, 23:40 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Also people below breathing air that is getting filtered through your foot sole 🥲
6/12/22, 23:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But this one is under NEFR and no bedding 🥲

6/13/22, 11:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: Then it's still not explained
6/13/22, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: My GPA for second semester increased
6/13/22, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: By .18
6/13/22, 12:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Summer is 4+3+2
6/13/22, 12:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
6/13/22, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: Then it doesn't make sense
6/13/22, 12:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interesting
6/13/22, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: .13
6/13/22, 12:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How did sem 3 increase by 4?
6/13/22, 12:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: I have no clue
6/13/22, 12:03 - Saamp🐍: I had gpa of 9.22 🥲🥲
6/13/22, 12:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: DS lab was 2 credits
6/13/22, 12:03 - Saamp🐍: In sem 2
6/13/22, 12:03 - Saamp🐍: It keeps on decreasing everytime result comes

6/13/22, 12:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ooo
6/13/22, 12:08 - Saamp🐍: I also gave credit

6/13/22, 12:11 - Saamp🐍: For ?
6/13/22, 12:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Arpan Sir took revenge
6/13/22, 12:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: People I asked
6/13/22, 12:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: So not relative
6/13/22, 12:11 - Saamp🐍: Of what?
6/13/22, 12:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: @919205513216 you predicted it 🥲
6/13/22, 12:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: Some r tompers
6/13/22, 12:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: Too
6/13/22, 12:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Probability
6/13/22, 12:11 - Saamp🐍: Arre 😂
6/13/22, 12:11 - Saamp🐍: Revenge of what
6/13/22, 12:11 - Saamp🐍: We didn't do anything
6/13/22, 12:11 - Saamp🐍: Ohhh
6/13/22, 12:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Cheating in his courses since sem1
6/13/22, 12:11 - Saamp🐍: We didn't do anything
6/13/22, 12:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is the cumulative revenge
6/13/22, 12:12 - Saamp🐍: I didn't
6/13/22, 12:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Neither did I. But everyone suffers
6/13/22, 12:12 - Saamp🐍: I didn't know cheating was possible in sem 1 😂😂
6/13/22, 12:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am regretting not cheating in 2nd or 3rd sem
6/13/22, 12:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ++ 😂
6/13/22, 12:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
6/13/22, 12:12 - Saamp🐍: If programming was in sem 1 I would've aced
6/13/22, 12:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I regret not cheating for life science 🥲
6/13/22, 12:13 - Saamp🐍: That means you did in other courses
6/13/22, 12:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nope, I didn't have to cheat to get good grades in other courses

6/13/22, 12:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 12:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: because i predict on parameters which are more likely to turn true
6/13/22, 12:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I understand 🥲
6/13/22, 12:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: The second part of probability taking toll on my mental health
6/13/22, 12:22 - Saamp🐍: Btw
6/13/22, 12:22 - Saamp🐍: Engineering drawing is not there
6/13/22, 12:22 - Saamp🐍: In the result
6/13/22, 12:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I was hoping it won't be true
6/13/22, 12:22 - Saamp🐍: Engineering design

6/13/22, 12:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents will soon gherao me
6/13/22, 12:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice
6/13/22, 12:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can't open my results until I reach home, Kerala
6/13/22, 12:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If I open here, whole family will make it a ceremony
6/13/22, 12:25 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
6/13/22, 12:25 - Saamp🐍: My family will never be able to make ceremony from my college result
6/13/22, 12:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you prepare some tactical ground if things are not as per your wish
6/13/22, 12:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 🤣🤣🤣, would be nice co-passengers sharing their though on your grade sheet
6/13/22, 12:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1
6/13/22, 12:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
6/13/22, 12:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This time my ceremony won't be happy
6/13/22, 12:27 - Saamp🐍: I have to study next sem
6/13/22, 12:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My mother was so upset that I got B in life science
6/13/22, 12:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Now this time 🥲
6/13/22, 12:27 - Saamp🐍: Otherwise my cgpa will go below 8

6/13/22, 13:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't remember him ever mentioning it either way
6/13/22, 13:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But we need one thing. Course instructors should declare the method of evaluation in a formally written mail in the beginning of the course
6/13/22, 13:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
6/13/22, 13:57 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but now since acad sec have gave them bypass. he (they) will definitely  play along these lines that they haven't said about relative grading
6/13/22, 13:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 13:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: Atleast he said so to me when I asked
6/13/22, 13:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He didn't say anything at all. That I am sure of
6/13/22, 13:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1 (also till this time they should continue relative since no prior information was floated )
6/13/22, 13:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ask Saarang once. He listens to every class
6/13/22, 13:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ++
6/13/22, 13:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: Still we have no proof if other people are secretly genius in probability
6/13/22, 13:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nobody is. We need class average and median
6/13/22, 13:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And standard deviation
6/13/22, 13:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 14:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I predict that this time the average and median shouldn't be too far off
6/13/22, 14:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I like ckn Sir. He shares the statistics properly, solutions, papers. We actually have some feedback and know what mistakes we made 🥲
6/13/22, 14:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1 (most teachers keep our papers and marks declassified as if it's some accident in socialist countries)
6/13/22, 14:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 14:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Mail also came now

6/13/22, 14:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Boycott Arpan Sir
6/13/22, 14:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I will never take any of his courses ever again
6/13/22, 14:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Last week I watched a few YouTube videos to learn more about statistical methods accompanying an ML course and I learnt more than what I understood from his classes
6/13/22, 15:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but he is not lone responsible
6/13/22, 15:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's not him alone, I know
6/13/22, 15:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Who all are? Boycott all of them
6/13/22, 15:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I honestly felt that I learnt very little in this course, and not because I put in any less efforts than I should have
6/13/22, 15:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I wrote a fairly feedback, but I feel I should have hone further to ensure that he never gets Btech maths courses again 🥲
6/13/22, 15:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't know how much blame will I put on shk. His sections of questions in the end sem paper were answerable
6/13/22, 15:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 16:44 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 16:44 - Lekshmi R Nair: Will this work?
6/13/22, 16:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So he will send a g form asking us to fill our probability grades?
6/13/22, 16:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yes
6/13/22, 16:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't know how many will fill it. If people are satisfied with their grades then they may not fill it, if people are very embarrassed, they may not fill it. I don't want acad sec to get into trouble for trying to "unofficially" collect grades. I don't know if this is something that can be done
6/13/22, 16:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But otherwise, it seems fine to me 🥲
6/13/22, 16:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I also want to see what will Arpan Sir reply to Balaji's email
6/13/22, 16:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 16:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 17:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Then it's fine
6/13/22, 17:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It should work
6/13/22, 17:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because looking at the sheer number of people who got C and D, this just can't be relative 🥲
6/13/22, 17:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 17:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 👌👍
6/13/22, 17:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Remember how in sem2 rohith sir published all the quiz marks publicly? 😂

6/13/22, 17:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: Whattttt
6/13/22, 17:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes. Exam was on 55 and quizzes 45
6/13/22, 17:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Initially they said they'll extrapolate that 45 to 50
6/13/22, 17:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But later they decided against it
6/13/22, 17:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: Thendikal
6/13/22, 17:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 17:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Once upon a time I really liked Arpan Sir. He taught really well too
6/13/22, 17:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But now that is a fairy tale that'll be passed down the generations
6/13/22, 17:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yes🥲
6/13/22, 17:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Branch change students aren't able to see intro to programming grades

6/13/22, 17:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They can't do one thing properly
6/13/22, 17:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also, other two summer courses aren't given right?
6/13/22, 17:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's nit

6/13/22, 17:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 21:46 - Lekshmi R Nair: Got one A, one S so far
6/13/22, 21:46 - Lekshmi R Nair: 8 Bs

6/13/22, 21:48 - Lekshmi R Nair: What's urs let's see
6/13/22, 21:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: C or D. Nothing else is possible. I know what I wrote in the exam 🥲
6/13/22, 21:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/13/22, 21:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't care anymore except for the fact that it'll bring my cgpa down heavily
6/13/22, 21:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I told my parents it can't be worse than a C or if I'm lucky even a B
6/13/22, 21:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: Tbh I am happy that this is a 3 credit course
6/13/22, 21:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They'll be more shocked than me. My mother was going to buy me a celebratory dress for my next birthday
6/13/22, 21:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
6/13/22, 21:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: How is it related to bday
6/13/22, 21:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I would have been happier if it were 1 credit
6/13/22, 21:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲🥲
6/13/22, 21:52 - Lekshmi R Nair: My parents have moved on
6/13/22, 21:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was probability, stochastic processes and statistics
6/13/22, 21:52 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😌😌😌😌
6/13/22, 21:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They removed stochastic processes from the syllabus. So they should cut one credit from the course
6/13/22, 21:52 - Lekshmi R Nair: The question was from a portion that the instructor took in a bad manner

6/14/22, 09:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Why you seem happy 👀🤐
6/14/22, 09:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because yesterday I filled the google form with D even without actually checking my grades 😎
6/14/22, 09:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sir's intentions are very firm. Requesting him is of no use. If like Yagnesh said they have to declare that grading will be absolute, we can bring this to higher authority, grievance committee or even more, then there is a chance
6/14/22, 09:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But remember, even in relative grading they can use skewed up constants and screw us up even more
6/14/22, 09:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: first D of life 🥲, celebrate your predictions on this occasion
6/14/22, 09:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>

6/14/22, 09:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oo
6/14/22, 09:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: D's, B's, A's and S's
6/14/22, 09:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In numerical order, A,S,B,D
6/14/22, 09:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: tomper 👀
6/14/22, 09:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I have a D 😎

6/14/22, 09:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/14/22, 09:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: From what I understand, standard deviation is pretty low this time. They can use it to decide ranges which are similar
6/14/22, 09:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I wonder how many people failed 🥲
6/14/22, 09:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 🥲
6/14/22, 09:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You know what? I'd rather redo this course as a backlog under another professor
6/14/22, 09:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Surely it won't be a D 🥲
6/14/22, 09:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: many as far as i know, some you can't even believe
6/14/22, 09:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
6/14/22, 09:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's really sad
6/14/22, 09:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sir was determined to screw us up from the very beginning
6/14/22, 09:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We never realized it
6/14/22, 09:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But every single decision along the way makes sense now
6/14/22, 09:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: no another same guys, though you can reach A or S if you are aware grading is going to be harsh
6/14/22, 09:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice

6/14/22, 09:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: majority "S" are few happy surprises i completely agree

6/14/22, 09:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ckn sir smiles more 😌
6/14/22, 09:30 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am pretty sure this is an old pic
6/14/22, 09:30 - Lekshmi R Nair: Cuz he is olddd
6/14/22, 09:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup
6/14/22, 09:30 - Lekshmi R Nair: Like 70 or so
6/14/22, 09:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but in your cases it is
6/14/22, 09:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh, that's old

6/14/22, 09:31 - Lekshmi R Nair: So 65?
6/14/22, 09:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: With greater cgpa comes greater expectations. Getting it once isn't enough. You have to be consistent. Otherwise it's an accident, not merit
6/14/22, 09:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh. 8 years older than my father
6/14/22, 09:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: Maybe paying attention to classes will help
6/14/22, 09:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am looking forward to offline
6/14/22, 09:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
6/14/22, 09:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Hopefully it'll be better 🥲
6/14/22, 09:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There isn't a 'D' in probability, but I got a 'D' in probability 🥲
6/14/22, 09:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In such times, I get creative
6/14/22, 09:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They removed stochastic processes from the syllabus, so I seriously think the should make it a 2 credit course 🥲
6/14/22, 09:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Or at least remove it from the course name
6/14/22, 09:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/14/22, 09:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Me sad sad. But there are two 'D's in sad sad, so should I be just sad?

6/14/22, 09:47 - Saamp🐍: F?
6/14/22, 09:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: U I believ

6/14/22, 09:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I and U
6/14/22, 09:47 - Saamp🐍: I is for incomplete right?
6/14/22, 09:48 - Saamp🐍: W is for attendance
6/14/22, 09:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: F and E people can go for improvement
6/14/22, 09:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: disciplinary
6/14/22, 09:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep, whole course repeat
6/14/22, 09:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Difference between I and U?
6/14/22, 09:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: U can repeat but can also write an supplementary just then
6/14/22, 09:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I want E if I can improve 🥹
6/14/22, 09:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
6/14/22, 09:49 - Saamp🐍: I is given when there's low marks!?
6/14/22, 09:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 🥲
6/14/22, 09:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yeah absolute low i guess
6/14/22, 09:50 - Saamp🐍: Sooo

6/14/22, 09:51 - Saamp🐍: Where do you know this from
6/14/22, 09:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: BTech regulations
6/14/22, 09:58 - Saamp🐍: But it is written something else there

6/14/22, 10:26 - Lekshmi R Nair: I think acad section messed up
6/14/22, 10:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I did really bad in probability
6/14/22, 10:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No, this time they didn't
6/14/22, 10:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Really bad, I can't describe
6/14/22, 10:28 - Lekshmi R Nair: BTW E grade can repeat?

6/14/22, 12:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: Eh
6/14/22, 12:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: The instructors are not supposed to share the information about class average, grade boundaries etc. with the students.

And what even is thus
6/14/22, 13:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No idea. Then I can sue the instructors of the calculus course for revealing my marks publicly and giving me mental trauma.
6/14/22, 13:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: They were mean
6/14/22, 13:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: Probability people
6/14/22, 13:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: Not calculus
6/14/22, 13:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Rohith sir actually gave me trauma. My parents saw those marks and started to compare 🥲
6/14/22, 13:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ++
6/14/22, 13:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is vengeance and not learning

6/14/22, 13:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: I really don't understand
6/14/22, 13:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't too. They aren't offering the course now right?
6/14/22, 13:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They have to repeat it in sem5 (if offered) or sem6
6/14/22, 13:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't want any other maths course
6/14/22, 13:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am considering repeating 🤔 should I?
6/14/22, 13:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You can't
6/14/22, 13:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: Or is it too much of a risk
6/14/22, 13:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You can't if you don't fail

6/14/22, 13:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's a fair risk given these professors 😂
6/14/22, 13:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I would love to create a system where there is more transparency in grades
6/14/22, 13:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Instructors can't refuse to give us statistics
6/14/22, 13:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😶‍🌫️they did
6/14/22, 13:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/14/22, 13:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How can so few people get A and B. They used skewed up constants to find the boundaries
6/14/22, 13:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Supplementry exams will be held soon
6/14/22, 13:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh makes sense
6/14/22, 13:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Let us know if there is another lays haul
6/14/22, 14:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Samuel Sir called me thinking I'm Sneha Gajbhiye ma'am 😶‍🌫

6/14/22, 17:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Try to trackdown daily routine of professor and then write a mail like what is the probability of him getting hit by a random black car if he doesn't revise grades? He might get impressed by your probability knowledge and might change the grade
6/14/22, 17:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: above
6/14/22, 17:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: in this difficult time such rare gems still haven't lost sanity
6/14/22, 17:39 - Saamp🐍: Btw I liked your idea more 😂
6/14/22, 17:39 - Saamp🐍: What if he doesn't
6/14/22, 17:39 - Saamp🐍: Then also he can't change the grade
6/14/22, 17:39 - Saamp🐍: So it's a win win
6/14/22, 17:39 - Saamp🐍: Worth a try
6/14/22, 17:39 - Saamp🐍: And while I type this

6/14/22, 23:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: But matter doesn't survive and thrive it just exist untill next supernova till then it keeping floating and getting distanced from its origin
6/14/22, 23:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: But still you depend on H, He and nebular hypothesis

6/14/22, 23:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Nasa would like have two words with you, they need a technician onward iss who is oxygen efficient
6/14/22, 23:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: You accept defeat

6/15/22, 12:15 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂😂🥲
6/15/22, 12:15 - Saamp🐍: That was hurtful

6/15/22, 13:30 - Lekshmi R Nair: https://youtube.com/shorts/ZtB3Tsn-32A?feature=share
Guess her age
6/15/22, 13:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She looks pretty young (15). But a closer look at her face and mannerisms tell me she is in her early 20s perhaps?
6/15/22, 13:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: 26😌
6/15/22, 14:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nice 😂
6/15/22, 14:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Although I wouldn't have been surprised she was 12

6/15/22, 17:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: I ignored his message for some time cuz I forgot 🥲🥲
He was really angry
6/15/22, 17:14 - Saamp🐍: So basically
6/15/22, 17:14 - Saamp🐍: He won't even let me do anything
6/15/22, 17:15 - Saamp🐍: What do I do?
6/15/22, 17:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: Make leader board🥲
6/15/22, 17:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: Dunno what else. Look at Susan's ideas
6/15/22, 17:15 - Saamp🐍: This can't go forever na
6/15/22, 17:16 - Saamp🐍: He's being an ass
6/15/22, 17:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How to make a leaderboard without any competitions being conducted?
6/15/22, 17:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Smack him
6/15/22, 17:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/15/22, 17:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Okay
6/15/22, 17:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Make an empty board then 😶‍🌫
6/15/22, 17:17 - Saamp🐍: And I won't announce core team
6/15/22, 17:17 - Saamp🐍: Fk him
6/15/22, 17:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/15/22, 17:18 - Saamp🐍: I'm thinking to resign
6/15/22, 17:18 - Saamp🐍: Tbh
6/15/22, 17:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
6/15/22, 17:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Scale those points down though
6/15/22, 17:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Then you're succumbing to him
6/15/22, 17:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲
6/15/22, 17:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Akshar needs you
6/15/22, 17:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/15/22, 17:20 - Saamp🐍: I'll write that cultural secretary is being an ass in the resignation
6/15/22, 17:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't want him to assume leadership of the club if you leave, as I think that's what he'll do
6/15/22, 17:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Then leaderboards should be made public to all the club heads
6/15/22, 17:21 - Lekshmi R Nair: It is
6/15/22, 17:21 - Saamp🐍: There's one more thing which I can do but it'll be like overcomplicating things
6/15/22, 17:21 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's one document
6/15/22, 17:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But that can cause conflicts in how valuable some contributions are
6/15/22, 17:21 - Lekshmi R Nair: What do u mean?
6/15/22, 17:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If I put some simple event at 1000 points
6/15/22, 17:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And half the council agrees with me and half doesn't and thinks it should be at 500
6/15/22, 17:21 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/15/22, 17:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/15/22, 17:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What is it?
6/15/22, 17:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Okay, I'll give 10,000 points for my event 😶‍🌫️
6/15/22, 17:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/15/22, 17:22 - Saamp🐍: If I get support I can remove Akshar from cc
6/15/22, 17:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: People are not that ridiculous 😂
6/15/22, 17:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How difficult is it?
6/15/22, 17:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm. What if I became a club head, say EBSB?
6/15/22, 17:23 - Saamp🐍: How difficult is it to get the support?
6/15/22, 17:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Very, people like Sai Prakesh
6/15/22, 17:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They get along okay, except for you both
6/15/22, 17:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Amritanshu has been typing for a while
6/15/22, 17:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/15/22, 17:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: No, it's part of life, getting things done under unfavourable circumstances is an important life skill. Just somehow get first competition done, things will be smooth then
6/15/22, 17:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's ur classmates, and they will suggest otherwise if point differences are that hugh
6/15/22, 17:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: Very very
6/15/22, 17:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I won't listen 😶‍🌫
6/15/22, 17:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: And Cultural council in a sense is a protection
6/15/22, 17:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂
6/15/22, 17:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And Sai Prakesh will vehemently oppose the idea
6/15/22, 17:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It'll be like Harsh has declared war against him
6/15/22, 17:26 - Lekshmi R Nair: If u r doing something,  cooperation is necessary.  Else it's inconveniencing unnecessarly a lot of people if the event is not that important
6/15/22, 17:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I know. That's why I'm not a club head 😶‍🌫
6/15/22, 17:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But you may meet such people in the future 😂
6/15/22, 17:26 - Saamp🐍: See that's why it's way simpler if I just resign
6/15/22, 17:26 - Saamp🐍: I will work as I want
6/15/22, 17:26 - Saamp🐍: Otherwise fuck it
6/15/22, 17:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sai will take over. Akshar will be his again 🥲
6/15/22, 17:27 - Lekshmi R Nair: But resigning will give u even less influence
6/15/22, 17:27 - Lekshmi R Nair: And not so good reputation? Can't say for sure tho
6/15/22, 17:27 - Saamp🐍: Don't worry I'll make a public resignation
6/15/22, 17:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes. It's as if you gave up
6/15/22, 17:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But they'll know
6/15/22, 17:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Think of all the work you put into becoming the head
6/15/22, 17:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How dear it's for you
6/15/22, 17:28 - Saamp🐍: Honestly I did nothing 😂🥲
6/15/22, 17:28 - Saamp🐍: Shouldn't have let him become the cult sec at the first place
6/15/22, 17:28 - Saamp🐍: 🙂🙂
6/15/22, 17:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You did research, you made a core team, you thought of events, you made a great community, you made everyone in the group comfortable
6/15/22, 17:28 - Saamp🐍: Btw I have thought about what amritanshu said just now like a million times
6/15/22, 17:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/15/22, 17:29 - Saamp🐍: Like this could be a learning opportunity for me for moments like
6/15/22, 17:29 - Saamp🐍: What if the place where I work
6/15/22, 17:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ++
6/15/22, 17:29 - Saamp🐍: Boss is not so helping
6/15/22, 17:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You can't resign
6/15/22, 17:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: At least if you're not financially well off to afford it
6/15/22, 17:30 - Saamp🐍: Oo you were talking about job 😂
6/15/22, 17:32 - Saamp🐍: Should I do one thing
6/15/22, 17:32 - Saamp🐍: Get those both done
6/15/22, 17:32 - Saamp🐍: And tell him
6/15/22, 17:32 - Saamp🐍: I've done it
6/15/22, 17:32 - Saamp🐍: But this is not the way to go
6/15/22, 17:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Yep that's why it's important
6/15/22, 17:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If you think it's worth a shot, then do it. Ultimately people will remember you and Akshar and not him
6/15/22, 17:34 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲I am pretty sure it will happen to all of us
6/15/22, 17:34 - Saamp🐍: Yeahh
6/15/22, 17:34 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't want to be software engineer
6/15/22, 17:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
6/15/22, 17:35 - Saamp🐍: Me too
6/15/22, 17:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: You must watch interview of Anil Swaroop . He was a former joint secretary in coal ministry after the scams in 2013 when no IAS was ready to take charge
6/15/22, 17:37 - Saamp🐍: Amritanshu if you become a civil officer don't forget us 🥺🥺🥺
6/15/22, 17:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Pulling job under favourable conditions becomes best experience in later life
6/15/22, 17:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Bruh 🥲
6/15/22, 17:38 - Saamp🐍: 🥲🥲🥲
6/15/22, 17:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Me neither
6/15/22, 17:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And also keep sending delicacies from where ever your posted 🥺
6/15/22, 17:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: People remember what they are fed

6/15/22, 17:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And also who feeds them

6/15/22, 17:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Trying new dishes and understanding them
6/15/22, 18:12 - Saamp🐍: My father always says this
6/15/22, 18:12 - Saamp🐍: .
6/15/22, 18:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My mother always says this 😂
6/15/22, 18:13 - Saamp🐍: He always tells me to go out and feed your friends 😂
6/15/22, 18:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There is a saying I guess
6/15/22, 18:13 - Saamp🐍: Even if it's a small occasion
6/15/22, 18:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My father says this, but my friends don't like to be fed 😂
6/15/22, 18:13 - Saamp🐍: I wouldn't mind🌝
6/15/22, 18:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Once I offered them an ice cream party because I was really happy. Everyone except for Lekshmi returned the money
6/15/22, 18:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Only she understands my sentiments
6/15/22, 18:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can't ho about spending lavishly either. I have a budget 😂
6/15/22, 18:14 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
6/15/22, 18:14 - Saamp🐍: We'll someday go out to eat

6/15/22, 18:28 - Lekshmi R Nair: Then maybe a teacher?
6/15/22, 18:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not lays 😂
6/15/22, 18:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interested in R&D in some company
6/15/22, 18:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In connection to this, I fondly remember the dosas I would eat from Bimbis whenever I went to Ernakulam with my mother. The khichdi I got as prasad from a temple in Kolkata was the best. And many more. These tastes will forever linger in my head 🙃
6/15/22, 18:55 - Saamp🐍: 😒😒😒
6/15/22, 18:55 - Saamp🐍: 'Stealer'
6/15/22, 19:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>

6/15/22, 19:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/15/22, 19:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Teacher requires a lot of patience. In the past my goal was to be a teacher. But now I realise it's not for me
6/15/22, 19:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Product development
6/15/22, 19:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No chips
6/15/22, 19:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I do remember food by the embarrassment caused while eating them like staining shirts by sabji in party 🥲
6/15/22, 19:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: then mba first?
6/15/22, 19:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>

6/15/22, 20:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The only thing that deters me is that it's Sujatha maam's course
6/15/22, 20:33 - Saamp🐍: Where are you seeing this?
6/15/22, 20:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Mail from acad sec with list of all GCEs
6/15/22, 20:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: @919499725866 which is the easiest GCE?

6/15/22, 21:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't particularly wanna take sujatha ma'am s course either

6/15/22, 21:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh

6/15/22, 21:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Neither do I
6/15/22, 21:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I really loved Reenu ma'am
6/15/22, 21:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But at the same time I don't want many people to her courses
6/15/22, 21:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They aren't very easy either. It's some work
6/16/22, 12:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: https://twitter.com/i/status/1537252503779090432

6/16/22, 22:45 - Lekshmi R Nair: It used to be oart of Indian subcontinent?
6/16/22, 22:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But mostly related to which language?
6/16/22, 22:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Is it?
6/16/22, 22:46 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but cost rises with prolonged arrogance

6/16/22, 22:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: + chola's ruled over a large part of southeast Asia
6/16/22, 22:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: Thailand was never under  British rule, so they rarely speak English.  Like everything is in their language which is very astonishing for people like us which use English terms more.
6/16/22, 22:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: In Thailand there is tradition of Ramleela
6/16/22, 22:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: Oooooo😲

6/16/22, 22:52 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Even largest temple is in Cambodia
6/16/22, 22:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: Is it influence or parts of our culture just later separated due to time, and rulers?
6/16/22, 22:55 - Amritanshu Raj CR: mainly due to influence through trade and a large part of Credit goes to Chola kingdom, though there are some mentions of Bali, Sumatra in ancient texts but since people consider them myths so...
6/16/22, 22:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🤔oo
6/16/22, 23:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sanskrit is a good bifurcation point, or even a joining point
6/16/22, 23:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I don't really want to continue this line of argument. It is a dangerous line that I probably shouldn't be pursuing 🥲
6/16/22, 23:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh, interesting
6/16/22, 23:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Or I may continue it after I return home. I feel I've got bored of this topic for now. I will pursue it after I return home
6/16/22, 23:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't take this as a retort. I didn't mean to be rude 🥲

6/17/22, 21:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Then you shouldn't try to interpret in 1st place. You should seek help from people who can interpret correctly maybe parents, close friends, a personalised AI model ...
6/17/22, 21:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh, kimds these days
6/17/22, 21:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥺

6/17/22, 21:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Then start training yourself. Better than any other thing 'Aatmanirbhar'

6/17/22, 21:52 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Develop you subconscious mind to be your friend. What people call their gut feeling , train it more reasonably, make it fierce when required, make it brave when necessary, make it calm when provoked, make it logical when thinking translucently, make it kind when in power, make it timid when unnecessary ego is involved

6/17/22, 22:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: But should you waste a week over a work which serves no purpose to anybody and will cost you your precious time which you can use in other productive works
6/17/22, 22:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Just like poppy 🤣
6/17/22, 22:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Exactly
6/17/22, 22:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😶‍🌫
6/17/22, 22:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/17/22, 22:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm already bored. I have time. I don't sleep a lot and I can't be studying for the entire day either 😂
6/17/22, 22:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: @919205513216
6/17/22, 22:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: Interested in being part of writers for Independence day play?
6/17/22, 22:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Yeah
6/17/22, 22:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Yeah
6/17/22, 22:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🤩🤩🤩
6/17/22, 22:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: Me adding you to script writers IIT Pkd
6/17/22, 22:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: Curtain call
6/17/22, 22:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: Hey guys...
We will be having our first on stage play after a long time on this Independence day(any format is fine)...
Any ideas on theme?
6/17/22, 22:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: This was the previous message
6/17/22, 22:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am inclined on how tribal culture is forgotten
6/17/22, 22:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: Like in states like Kerala
6/17/22, 22:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: Their language is looked down uoon
6/17/22, 22:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: More suggestions I need
6/17/22, 22:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: But don't you think framing an innocent guy who is mostly friendly to you and is sometimes a bit funny is just too much of revenge?
6/17/22, 22:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Like they are portrayed dancing around fire on a hu-lu-lu music in mainstream entertenment media
6/17/22, 22:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's sad 🥲
6/17/22, 22:10 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yes. But then, whatever I write will also come from a place of ignorance
6/17/22, 22:10 - Lekshmi R Nair: I have a lot of stories
6/17/22, 22:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 'Framing' is a strong word. I merely said I'll make you well known
6/17/22, 22:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: And that is like charge to me
6/17/22, 22:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/17/22, 22:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Charge: chargesheet a document investigation agency files against accused in court mention all his crimes / bad deeds
6/17/22, 22:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh 🥲
6/17/22, 22:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: I have pretty cool folk horror stories though
6/17/22, 22:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: Won't come under the theme
6/17/22, 22:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How come? I can glorify your name
6/17/22, 22:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have no list of crimes commuted by you, just good deeds
6/17/22, 22:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Why I need my name ti be glorified, I am good with the way it is, simple and unnoticed, no unnecessary eyes bother me, no unnecessary conversations, no unnecessary burden of expectations
6/17/22, 22:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/17/22, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True. I could have chosen a simple life, but then it didn't go that way
6/17/22, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Although I've no idea if that life will be good for me or not
6/17/22, 22:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Exactly, it depends upon individual choices. Though each way (chosen wisely) leads to same destination but with different experiences and sometimes different travel times
6/17/22, 22:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: You seem happy then why regretting unnecessarily?
6/17/22, 22:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True
6/17/22, 22:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not regretting, I didn't put my words properly in this message
6/17/22, 22:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I really enjoyed the way this time. Regardless of the destination I've met people who make this journey memorable
6/17/22, 22:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Noice
6/17/22, 22:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: That's how it should be as we say "The journey is a reward as well as destination" . In the end only happiness matters but we need to understand and accept different people might not agree with one definition of happiness. I personally think people fade away but purpose won't.
6/17/22, 23:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/17/22, 23:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True
6/17/22, 23:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True. People matter. They'll come and go. They won't remember you. You won't remember them. But they were once there and they mattered and they impacted my life in some way or the other that'll be with me till the end
6/17/22, 23:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: But don't you thing that's your experience and not their contribution. Like you are not able to take planned steps then be it calculated steps and you will be defining your experience with others and others can't have an arbitrary role in your life
6/17/22, 23:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/17/22, 23:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I have a big collection of over 7 years now though most of it doesn't make much sense now but they do help me reflect how I evolved
6/17/22, 23:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: over the years
6/17/22, 23:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's nice to see how we once were
6/17/22, 23:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: At one point of time I would cringe at things I did in the past. Now I look back and reflect
6/17/22, 23:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Makes sense. But I like to believe that people shape me meaningfully in a way
6/17/22, 23:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Yeah and also you learn from it
6/17/22, 23:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1 🥲, I always do
6/17/22, 23:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Apart from teachers and parents you shouldn't allow others to shape you in general. You are unique and no one else can understand you better than yourself
6/17/22, 23:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Too much philosophy 🤐👀🤣
6/17/22, 23:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes. Shaping you needn't be a huge change. It can be a pin prick here and there. I am in control of how much others affect me. At least now I hope I am, not the me of the past 🥲
6/17/22, 23:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/17/22, 23:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Yep, that's the point, I pick good out of all without even letting them know though I do respect em for their role which they don't know they played in my life. In this way I am the driver of the change
6/17/22, 23:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/17/22, 23:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/17/22, 23:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Indeed
6/17/22, 23:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: See even though I knew you wouldn't be doing so still by being diplomatic I saved myself from escalation 😎
6/17/22, 23:52 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I remember a similar instance when one of seniors asked me how would I react if he starts ragging me badly?
I told him definitely I wouldn't be ragged 'badly' but still if it happens I will co-operate. He was shocked by my answer and told me no one else answered him anything peaceful like that
6/17/22, 23:53 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I again saved myself from a situation going volatile and unnecessary grudge (esp he was telegu )
6/18/22, 08:47 - Saamp🐍: Great
6/18/22, 08:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Smort 😂
6/18/22, 08:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh, good answer. I don't know what would I have answered though 🥲
Depends on my state of mind at that point of time
6/18/22, 08:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
6/18/22, 08:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 12:58 - Lekshmi R Nair: Smart😲
6/18/22, 12:58 - Lekshmi R Nair: I would have said something since I am easily riled up and then caused a fight
6/18/22, 12:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😶‍🌫️
6/18/22, 12:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: I almost fought with a telugu senior who did foulplay against my roommate in a game during Diwali
6/18/22, 12:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😶‍🌫️
6/18/22, 12:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True, I would have done something similar, but in lesser magnitude
6/18/22, 12:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: Anyways that senior is nice to me now, so it's fine ig
6/18/22, 13:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😶‍🌫
6/18/22, 13:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😶‍🌫
6/18/22, 13:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😶‍🌫😶‍🌫😶‍🌫
6/18/22, 13:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: They were scamming her😶‍🌫️🥲
6/18/22, 13:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes, and she wouldn't have done anything to oppose 🥲
6/18/22, 13:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 13:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 13:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 13:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh 🥲, that's another good option provided you have enough muscle/mental power
6/18/22, 13:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 13:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: Me girl
6/18/22, 13:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: If u physically fight me, u die
6/18/22, 13:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
6/18/22, 13:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😶‍🌫😶‍🌫😶‍🌫
6/18/22, 13:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Me don't pick fights with boyfriends because they don't hit me back
6/18/22, 13:46 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Women empowerment
6/18/22, 13:46 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 13:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Muscle power doesn't necessarily require going in a physical fights you just project yourself being powerful and in most cases opponent will back off
6/18/22, 13:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: Eh
6/18/22, 13:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh, maybe because of your cartel contacts 👀
6/18/22, 13:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 13:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't like physical fights
6/18/22, 13:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: Or, "if u fight me, it will cause social death" will also work
6/18/22, 13:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: then either you should go calm measure or should try to look visibly powerful
6/18/22, 13:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Dhemki 👀🤐😂
6/18/22, 13:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 13:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *Boy--friends 🥲
6/18/22, 13:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Matlab most of them won't react when I hit them, so it's not a fair fight
6/18/22, 14:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I like engaging in duels with people
6/18/22, 16:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: When violence is in your blood 🤐👀🤣
6/18/22, 16:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't think it's in my blood. My blood test came all clear 😶‍🌫
6/18/22, 16:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 16:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Then maybe in bones
6/18/22, 16:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: But it is somewhere inside else you won't hit people unnecessarily
6/18/22, 16:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 16:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh, I'll have to test for that then. What test do I have to do to confirm it?
6/18/22, 16:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Alright, I'll do a full body checkup
6/18/22, 17:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: The hammer on foot test
6/18/22, 17:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: So you doubt you might have something
6/18/22, 17:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 17:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh, I'll have to find a hammer first. So all I have to do is to bang the hammer on my foot?
6/18/22, 17:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Which foot? And how do I know if the test returns positive or negative?
6/18/22, 17:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You never know until it's confirmed
6/18/22, 18:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: That's more than enough since the test was a psychological one. I never mentioned you to bang but still you got the violent thought first. You have been detected violence positive
6/18/22, 18:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 18:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 18:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I see, but that's what anyone will think. This test of yours exploits normal human psychology. Humans tend to perceive an object with their use. Hence hammer is to bang
6/18/22, 18:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: But who will hammer his/her own foot obviously someone with violent thought process 👀
6/18/22, 18:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 18:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Anyone could. You never mentioned how hard I should hammer
6/18/22, 18:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: because I never asked you to hammer in first place
6/18/22, 18:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: You assumed it on own
6/18/22, 18:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Human behavior. Give them a hammer and they'll use it to hit something
6/18/22, 19:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/18/22, 21:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Human behavior can't be used to formulate biased conclusions
6/18/22, 22:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: You ok?

6/19/22, 12:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that was a joke 🥲. if you are in Egypt and not living in a pyramid then are you even in Egypt 👀 then dad has better comeback than expected
6/19/22, 12:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhhh 😂
6/19/22, 12:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nice
6/19/22, 12:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: on this occasion (when you need to explain a joke):

6/19/22, 12:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂😂😂

6/19/22, 14:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Your soul left the body for a second. Does it mean you were reborn?
6/19/22, 14:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So your new birthday is today
6/19/22, 14:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Do you remember anything from your past life?
6/19/22, 14:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/19/22, 14:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can describe your past self. You went by the name of Lekshmi R Nair. A B Tech CSE student at IIT Palakkad
6/19/22, 14:55 - Amritanshu Raj CR: But why?
6/19/22, 14:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Isn't that what lunatics are supposed to do?
6/19/22, 14:55 - Amritanshu Raj CR: People can't even remember from last sem and you forcing her to remember past life
6/19/22, 14:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can describe your family too. Do you remember them?
6/19/22, 14:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>

6/21/22, 21:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: C and D are frequent occurrences (though i expect you won't be aware of this fact due to obvious reasons) they can't allow supplementary also E is a passing grade(borderline) so no supplementary exams

6/21/22, 21:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why, just why 🥲
6/21/22, 21:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: When so many students have received such poor grades in a course, there must be something fishy 🥲
6/21/22, 22:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Rules 🥲
6/21/22, 22:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but there is no way to point this out if professor said people performed poor
6/21/22, 22:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Who made these rules? Why can they not be amended? 🥲
6/21/22, 22:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
We agree to that. But relative grading would mean it shouldn't reflect that heavily upon the grades
6/21/22, 22:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If it's otherwise then it's not relative grading 🥲

6/23/22, 15:49 - Saamp🐍: That's when mid life crisis will start
6/23/22, 15:49 - Saamp🐍: Because you'll be free and have money at once
6/23/22, 15:49 - Saamp🐍: You might completely spend it
6/23/22, 15:49 - Saamp🐍: And a free mind is a house to evil thoughts
6/23/22, 15:50 - Saamp🐍: So as a software developer you might be busy and earn good
6/23/22, 15:50 - Saamp🐍: But at the same time there is a possibility of getting bored
6/23/22, 15:50 - Saamp🐍: Seeing others enjoying their life
6/23/22, 15:50 - Saamp🐍: Getting married
6/23/22, 15:50 - Saamp🐍: While you'll be far away from your home your family loved ones
6/23/22, 15:51 - Saamp🐍: And will be surrounded by evil selfish people
6/23/22, 15:51 - Saamp🐍: Which will make you quit
6/23/22, 15:51 - Saamp🐍: And find another career
6/23/22, 15:51 - Saamp🐍: Or go for higher studies let's say mba
6/23/22, 15:51 - Saamp🐍: And so so soo on
6/23/22, 15:51 - Saamp🐍: You can keep on thinking like this
6/23/22, 15:51 - Saamp🐍: Until you'll realise there's nothing you can do right
6/23/22, 15:52 - Saamp🐍: So right now just focus on improving your cgpa

6/23/22, 20:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You know what, I've grown as a person after this trip
6/23/22, 20:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You folks probably won't see any changes. But it has affected me in how I treat those very close to me
6/23/22, 20:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/23/22, 20:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And it was very refreshing to meet someone, namely my brother who actually treats me like an adolescent and not a kid

6/23/22, 20:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not really. It has taught me more about violence 😂
6/23/22, 20:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I usually don't get into family fights and do everything my parents want me to do
6/23/22, 20:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I realized that I have grown. I'm not always wrong. They aren't always right. And I should interfere and voice my opinion more in family affairs. Even if it means I have to bark my life out to get them to listen to me
6/23/22, 20:41 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Wow, seems you aspire for more weight to your voice in family discussions. Good for you and also your brother
6/23/22, 20:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents will always treat me like a kid, but that shouldn't stop me from educating them about what I know better, especially the internet and health
6/23/22, 20:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup
6/23/22, 20:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: It might be he also was treated like kid then he understood your conditions
6/23/22, 20:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My brother is very frank 😂

6/23/22, 20:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He made me feel so important 😂
6/23/22, 20:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True. He said he had to bark his lungs out until something happened and people began to listen to him
6/23/22, 20:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😶‍🌫️🥲
6/23/22, 20:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was an awesome experience overall. I never thought we'll get along so well after not seeing each other for 5 years
6/23/22, 20:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I got to learn and understand pain and family struggles better
6/23/22, 20:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My other brother got transferred to Ahemadabad and he had some important work, so sadly couldn't meet him 🥲
6/23/22, 20:52 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Like this, You should always let your parents about your thoughts. It will pave way for a future two way communication channel will be helpful to both also you will have some influence though you must remember it's ok to disagree sometimes but not ok to contradict always

6/26/22, 12:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: सरफरोशी की तमन्ना अब हमारे दिल में है
- By Ram Prasad Bismil

सरफरोशी की तमन्ना अब हमारे दिल में है,
देखना है जोर कितना बाजुए कातिल में है ।

करता नहीं क्यों दुसरा कुछ बातचीत,
देखता हूँ मैं जिसे वो चुप तेरी महफिल मैं है ।

रहबर राहे मौहब्बत रह न जाना राह में
लज्जत-ऐ-सेहरा नवर्दी दूरिये-मंजिल में है ।

यों खड़ा मौकतल में कातिल कह रहा है बार-बार
क्या तमन्ना-ए-शहादत भी किसी के दिल में है ।

ऐ शहीदे-मुल्को-मिल्लत मैं तेरे ऊपर निसार
अब तेरी हिम्मत का चर्चा ग़ैर की महफिल में है ।

वक्त आने दे बता देंगे तुझे ऐ आसमां,
हम अभी से क्या बतायें क्या हमारे दिल में है ।

खींच कर लाई है सब को कत्ल होने की उम्मींद,
आशिकों का जमघट आज कूंचे-ऐ-कातिल में है ।

सरफरोशी की तमन्ना अब हमारे दिल में है,
देखना है जोर कितना बाजुए कातिल में है
6/26/22, 12:16 - Saamp🐍: Ohh ram prasad bismil 😂
6/26/22, 12:16 - Saamp🐍: Forgot him
6/26/22, 12:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yeah, ram prasad bismil quoted it which made the original song famous
6/26/22, 12:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: poet is a different guy maybe faiz Ahmed though i'm not sure
6/26/22, 12:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: The poem is so good at like inciting emotions
6/26/22, 12:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yep. Bismil azeembadi
6/26/22, 12:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: Or something
6/26/22, 12:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oo, ok
6/26/22, 12:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: Many people have asked me about the lyrics used in the movie 'Rang De Basanti'. Here it goes -- though remember these lines are not part of the original poem written by 'Ram Prasad Bismil'.

है लिये हथियार दुश्मन ताक मे बैठा उधर
और हम तैय्यार हैं सीना लिये अपना इधर
खून से खेलेंगे होली गर वतन मुश्किल में है
सरफरोशी की तमन्ना अब हमारे दिल में है

हाथ जिनमें हो जुनून कटते नही तलवार से
सर जो उठ जाते हैं वो झुकते नहीं ललकार से
और भडकेगा जो शोला सा हमारे दिल में है
सरफरोशी की तमन्ना अब हमारे दिल में है

हम तो घर से निकले ही थे बांधकर सर पे कफ़न
जान हथेली में लिये लो बढ चले हैं ये कदम
जिंदगी तो अपनी मेहमान मौत की महफ़िल मैं है
सरफरोशी की तमन्ना अब हमारे दिल में है

दिल मे तूफानों की टोली और नसों में इन्कलाब
होश दुश्मन के उडा देंगे हमे रोको न आज
दूर रह पाये जो हमसे दम कहाँ मंजिल मे है
सरफरोशी की तमन्ना अब हमारे दिल में है

I actually recited thus
6/26/22, 12:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: same old answer you compensate it

6/26/22, 18:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Can't expect Hindi for every single term, somewhere we will falter. That's how much English has infiltrated into our lives

6/26/22, 20:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: today one guy in hindi debate was saying Agniveer scheme is to make India a 5 'million' economy,
I told him becoming a 5 mn economy from here is a lot more difficult than a 5 trillion economy for us
6/26/22, 20:51 - Saamp🐍: If you tell me the names of the people who asked you to sneak on me then I'll pay

6/26/22, 20:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True
6/26/22, 20:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yeah, that's tough 🥲
6/26/22, 20:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was talking to my brother in English about something and a neighborhood kid started to speak mean things about to me to someone sitting adjacent to me 🥲
I let it go on for 10 minutes before I got up and left 😂
6/26/22, 20:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Let them have fun 😌

6/26/22, 21:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I should have brought my shoes
6/26/22, 21:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Now I'll have to spray fungicides on them
6/26/22, 21:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice

6/26/22, 21:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/26/22, 21:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No, I do understand it. But not my kind of humour. Doesn't strike me 🥲
6/26/22, 21:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not that it's not my kind of humour, but I don't know what to say now 😂
6/26/22, 21:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i was planning to take foreign language course (maybe german) in the recent mail from dean but then i saw the fees
6/26/22, 21:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: +++ 😂

6/26/22, 21:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *thing
6/26/22, 21:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Very high on the relatibility index 🥲
6/26/22, 21:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was thinking it's free or low cost. Starred the mail when I saw it and opened it today to read through it 😂
6/26/22, 21:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 🥲, high level humour for elite people like you 👀🤣
6/26/22, 21:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/26/22, 21:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: and that too 15 thousand 👀 maybe i would have considered it if less (very less to be exact)
6/26/22, 21:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/26/22, 21:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup 😂
I would have gone for it if it were under 1000. I even talked to my father about it
6/26/22, 21:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why are women's shoes more expensive than their male counterparts? Is there some science to it being better suited to our biologically different feet or is it marketing?
6/26/22, 21:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And why are so many of them pink? 🥲
6/26/22, 21:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And what's the difference between male deoderant and female deoderant? 🥲
6/26/22, 21:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: middle class things 🥲 (though i'm not sure if you fall in this category)
6/26/22, 21:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: Wha? How much
6/26/22, 21:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I use one deo once gifted to my father and people have asked me umpteen times, 'why male'?
6/26/22, 21:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 15k
6/26/22, 21:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
6/26/22, 21:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was once semi upper middle class, but now we dropped by at least one level
6/26/22, 21:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 1k for IIT Kanpur led 2 sem course is worth the bargain imo
6/26/22, 21:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: maybe because in general women buy more shoes than men. men (most of them) buy another shoe after breaking one but women have collections and hence rising demands which may result in raising the price
6/26/22, 21:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: gender bias
6/26/22, 21:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: also more handicraft work on the shoes for women hence skilled labour another factor
6/26/22, 21:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh 🤔
But isn't that biased to a certain section of the economic strata, namely upper middle class and above
6/26/22, 21:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm referring to sneakers and normal looking things, nothing fancy
6/26/22, 21:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 🥲
6/26/22, 21:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And these people normally purchase branded stuff
6/26/22, 21:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What about local and not so popular brands?
6/26/22, 21:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If they keep up with this pricing system, won't it affect their business?
6/26/22, 21:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: also in lower middle class women generally don't wear shoes (chappals) hence supply is generally focused on the spending section of middle class
6/26/22, 21:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm saying coz I've seen not very popular brands price their women's shoes way higher than men's. And in showrooms, not online
6/26/22, 21:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True 🤔
6/26/22, 21:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: when handy craft raises the price also margin profit then who will supply simple shoes costing less (reducing the margin)
6/26/22, 21:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: local(organised) shoe industry has almost vanished after pollution laws took a toll on leather industry
6/26/22, 21:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh 🥲
6/26/22, 21:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/26/22, 21:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: people have been become accustomed to brands which led decline in local shoe industry also they can't compete with large firms as they can produce same old models but firms can bring new models (comfort/fashion/use) effectively eliminating competition
6/26/22, 21:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But price? 🥲
6/26/22, 21:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>

6/26/22, 22:34 - Lekshmi R Nair: How tall are u btw in feet and inches?

6/27/22, 14:14 - Saamp🐍: There must be some people funding this...
6/27/22, 14:14 - Saamp🐍: Just like telegram
6/27/22, 14:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep, might be as the co-founder of Wikipedia has accused that wikipedia is becoming extremely woke and intolerant to rival political narratives due to woke influence (may be funding)
6/27/22, 14:29 - Saamp🐍: Oooo
6/27/22, 14:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhhh
6/27/22, 14:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I donated some money. In the future I'll do a bit more
6/27/22, 14:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True in a way, but not everyone will go to such lengths for something
6/27/22, 14:58 - Lekshmi R Nair: That's so scary
6/27/22, 14:58 - Lekshmi R Nair: The things we read are manipulated
6/27/22, 15:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: thats why good EQ and logical deduction is the need of time while reading/watching news/rumours
6/27/22, 15:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but you planned to do so after job?
6/27/22, 15:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup, changed my mind 😶‍🌫️

6/27/22, 20:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 20:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Didn't get the bottle and 200 rupee thing

6/27/22, 20:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Is it Lekshmi?
6/27/22, 20:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I don't drink. If they give me 10kg pure ghee Mysore pak I may consider it

6/27/22, 21:02 - Lekshmi R Nair: Trur
6/27/22, 21:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have some aunts and uncles there, but I don't really like going there with my parents. I don't actually like going anywhere with my parents. Each of them are very grumpy at their respective in laws' place and it makes things very miserable for me
6/27/22, 21:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: There is never actually choice? Like movies and shows glorify communism as if it gave us something good. But companies are leaving Kerala,  we are in a huge debt....
6/27/22, 21:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I already told my aunt if I ever visit them again, I would like to come solo and not with my parents
6/27/22, 21:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: Nice
6/27/22, 21:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Still don't get it 🥲
6/27/22, 21:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: So according to youth communism is great
6/27/22, 21:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I understand it literally, but not at a deeper level
6/27/22, 21:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
6/27/22, 21:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂people xan actually think that way right?

6/27/22, 21:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: U choose which means more to u, and vote
6/27/22, 21:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: I saw so many freaking movies saying how communism is fir youth. And how noble it is
6/27/22, 21:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
6/27/22, 21:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
6/27/22, 21:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: That made me kinda dislike it?
6/27/22, 21:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: Also some malayalis came up to me and be like u don't eat beef in Kerala? U not malayali
6/27/22, 21:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but why do you need to act against the rules of the host 🥲
6/27/22, 21:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: And that piece of shit wanted a debate
6/27/22, 21:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😶‍🌫
6/27/22, 21:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have to research a lot before voting. Although I think my conclusions will be non conclusive and then NOTA? 🥲 don't really know

6/27/22, 21:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So many people don't eat beef

6/27/22, 21:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: Or something
6/27/22, 21:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep, but now i think they are trying to do some reforms likr semi-highspeed rail etc though i know they are not as good as portrayed
6/27/22, 21:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: was it a threat?🤣
6/27/22, 21:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: Previous finance minister loved loans
6/27/22, 21:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My stomach is really fragile in Assam weather. I need specific kinds of food which I don't get because everyone wants something different. And usually the loudest voice is heard
6/27/22, 21:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: leave it i guess not that necessary
6/27/22, 21:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: Don't pay attention to current one so I dunno.
6/27/22, 21:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh
6/27/22, 21:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: Like if I am to judge them fir eating beef, it's overstepping.  But I didn't say anything like that😂
6/27/22, 21:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: While me being a meat eater
6/27/22, 21:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: communism in it's abstract form is something people living inside the country hate (China of 1960s)
6/27/22, 21:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 21:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: I dunno what I feel about the ideology.  I think it's impractical and that's it🤔
6/27/22, 21:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: But people executing it, I doubt they would live the life of a common man, and earn same as everyone
6/27/22, 21:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: malayalis? i though they flourished of freedom of choices and now they forcing the same opposite
6/27/22, 21:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🌝🌝
6/27/22, 21:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: Freedom of choice is usually never truly free
6/27/22, 21:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: Even the people advocating will have certain thing in mind
6/27/22, 21:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: Heck, even if I do it, I will have a specific version in mind
6/27/22, 21:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: everybody loves loans but not the down payments

6/27/22, 21:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 21:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: the ideology effectively believes on freezing everything to make things even like they won't invest in infra at all in order to show they are eager for HDI development though they ain't doing any better there too
6/27/22, 21:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Intellectual conversations going on. Me taking notes 🫠
6/27/22, 21:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that's the point
6/27/22, 21:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 21:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>

6/27/22, 21:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 21:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Scientific maybe yes, intellect I doubt 😂
6/27/22, 21:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: https://twitter.com/i/status/1541396513326526464
6/27/22, 21:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also remind me of yesterday's debate
6/27/22, 21:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I feel the psychedelic drug one had a lot of potential
6/27/22, 21:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But for that you'll have to read and cite research papers
6/27/22, 21:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *wasted potential
6/27/22, 21:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was alright though. But because it is a very research based topic I expected. a lot more from it
6/27/22, 21:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that's why i played both the words together otherwise you would have simply refused
6/27/22, 21:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Smart bot
6/27/22, 21:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Now I have plenty of pictures of you from the debate to work on for my new stickers
6/27/22, 21:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: intellect is not just political science, it's a lot more where you are gifted
6/27/22, 21:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: when, where and why
6/27/22, 21:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True 🤔
I have a cousin who is deeply interested in political science. He is trying for UPSC with that as an extra subject (not very sure though)
6/27/22, 21:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: maybe not gifted but result of hard and consistent work
6/27/22, 21:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: When: yesterday evening
Where: auditorium
Why: because I want to
6/27/22, 21:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You're current affair and worldly knowledge is what my father once envisioned me to be like, he really wants me to have those attributes 😶‍🌫️
6/27/22, 21:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice
6/27/22, 21:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i will reply in 2 mins
6/27/22, 21:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Take your time, don't have to say 😂
6/27/22, 21:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: "I want to" 👀 btw where did you access them?
6/27/22, 22:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but why did he would, apart from general knowledge for exams there isn't much application for them
6/27/22, 22:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Drive link Harsh shared with all pictures 😂
6/27/22, 22:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I know, but sometimes parents want their children to be everything they aren't
6/27/22, 22:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They as in children
6/27/22, 22:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep though this problem generally arises when children do exceptionally well academically 👀
6/27/22, 22:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: "Great Expectations" 🫠
6/27/22, 22:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My friends' parents always compared me to their children which caused friction. Parents shouldn't compare and berate 🥲
A but is fine, but it should be constructive
6/27/22, 22:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Moreover my father was a known figure in my school and a very important figure throughout my education. And j greatly admire him for that. But often what happens is that people credit him and God for my achievements more than me. After my boards so many people called him. I got less than 5 calls. And everyone congratulated him for leading me to success. Very few of them asked him to give the phone to me so that they could congratulate me too 🥲
6/27/22, 22:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: WHAT
6/27/22, 22:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: U git the marks
6/27/22, 22:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🫥🫥🫥🫥
6/27/22, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I understand it. I never went to any tuitions except for JEE coaching. Father greatly helped in everything. But sometimes I want to listen to some appreciation too
6/27/22, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 22:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: I also didn't 👀
If u studied by yourself too,u could have done the same
6/27/22, 22:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's u who deserves the credit
6/27/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My mother is indifferent. I've realized lately that my parents come from very similar, yet very different circumstances and they have vastly different priorities for me and their dreams for me are different
6/27/22, 22:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's the duty of parents to provide best possible education to their dependent.  You were the one who studied and write the exam.
6/27/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yeah, that's true
6/27/22, 22:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's easy in pur culture to be guilt trip by parents
6/27/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: +1
6/27/22, 22:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: But their parents would do the same and also we would fir out children
6/27/22, 22:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: Our
6/27/22, 22:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: I dunno if I ever want a child
6/27/22, 22:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: Child birth is horrifying
6/27/22, 22:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ur brain changes
6/27/22, 22:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ++
6/27/22, 22:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ur abs split into two
6/27/22, 22:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲🥲🥲
6/27/22, 22:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: Backpain
6/27/22, 22:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But more than that I don't know if I can be a good parent
6/27/22, 22:25 - Lekshmi R Nair: That shit is scary
6/27/22, 22:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If I ever marry I'll be clear that I don't want children
6/27/22, 22:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 22:25 - Lekshmi R Nair: Why do u think so?
6/27/22, 22:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't know 🥲
Requires a lot of selflessness 🥲
6/27/22, 22:25 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yes. If u truly don't want, it should be made clear, before marriage
6/27/22, 22:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Can I care for someone more than me?
6/27/22, 22:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: As of now that's what my views are. May change in another 10 years
6/27/22, 22:26 - Lekshmi R Nair: Isn't having a child in someway selfish too? Like it's a source of joy for some people,  the children
6/27/22, 22:26 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yep
6/27/22, 22:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True 🤔
6/27/22, 22:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't know if I can derive such joy
6/27/22, 22:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't even believe in the institution of marriage 😂
Children is far away
6/27/22, 22:27 - Lekshmi R Nair: Maybe,  maybe not. I care about my sister. Maybe I would care a lot more about my daughter. Dunno. Anyways I also do t know if I want a biological child.
6/27/22, 22:27 - Lekshmi R Nair: I like the idea. Of calling someone urs. Legally😂
6/27/22, 22:27 - Lekshmi R Nair: I like my abs unsplit
6/27/22, 22:27 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🫥🫥🫥
6/27/22, 22:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True. I have no siblings and don't live with anyone else
6/27/22, 22:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm used to being cared for, rather than caring for others
6/27/22, 22:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 22:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: hmm
6/27/22, 22:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh, but that's ok, too much appreciation brings the attentiveness so he kind of helped you by keeping irrelevant things far from your
6/27/22, 22:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you wanna some appreciation? 👀🤣
6/27/22, 22:34 - Lekshmi R Nair: I disagree kind wise sir
6/27/22, 22:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: I agree with u on  most things
6/27/22, 22:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥺🫡
6/27/22, 22:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not now, but back then yes 😂
If I do something commendable then yes. Otherwise it's just buttering me with a knife 😶‍🌫️
6/27/22, 22:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't know how things would have gone the other way. I can just speculate 😂
6/27/22, 22:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep, there are contrasts it also depends upon how there life unfolded, who they admire (apart from you obviously) as role models and also who/what they hate like my mother hates fancy hair styles though that shouldn't be the case but still i keep it simple to make her happy and lately i also started liking it
6/27/22, 22:40 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you have every right to be but if you think most of them would have repeated same things and also there is a ego factor in Indian parents (proud parents of a super child🤣)
6/27/22, 22:41 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 22:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: +1
6/27/22, 22:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents were brought up with different moral values. Now they are trying the same of me which causes some friction because they are so different
6/27/22, 22:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: if you need appreciation anytime just give us ice cream party and we will go on an rampage to appreciate you 🤣
6/27/22, 22:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Okay, next time ice cream party from me 😌
6/27/22, 22:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Once we went to food court on a friend's birthday and I was elated and told everyone that I'll give an ice cream treat to everyone in home center. Everyone except for Lekshmi returned the money 🥲
6/27/22, 22:44 - Saamp🐍: Wait I've seen this msg somewhere
6/27/22, 22:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My friends don't know how to honor a heart felt treat or the sentiments associated with it 🥲
6/27/22, 22:44 - Saamp🐍: This exact one
6/27/22, 22:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Maybe in the group 😂
6/27/22, 22:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I may have ranted out before
6/27/22, 22:44 - Saamp🐍: .
6/27/22, 22:45 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
6/27/22, 22:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nice 😂
6/27/22, 22:45 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i think acknowledgement with little appreciation is better, since they owned whole thing, it would help reduce emotional stress
6/27/22, 22:45 - Saamp🐍: Lekshmi thendi
6/27/22, 22:45 - Lekshmi R Nair: I actually didn't know that🤔😂
I like free icecream

6/27/22, 22:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you can buy things Sneha own rn for half and trade them off for profit allowing to buy even more chocolates if you love them so much
6/27/22, 22:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't wanna buy more chocolates
6/27/22, 22:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: So I avoid going to homecenter
6/27/22, 22:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲

6/27/22, 22:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Just poppy things (oh sorry you asked not to comment on your business, oh sorry it's not your business 👀 )🤣
6/27/22, 22:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>

6/27/22, 22:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: From next time
6/27/22, 22:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: Today I went to store, and didn't buy chocolates 🤩🤩🤩
6/27/22, 22:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: certainly not 1 lakh which you transfer in peoples account to get them in trouble ☠️🤣
6/27/22, 22:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My mother is convinced I'm diabetic
6/27/22, 22:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: I bought paneer instead
6/27/22, 22:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The happiness 😂
6/27/22, 22:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😋
6/27/22, 22:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 23:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: What. Why?
6/27/22, 23:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm convinced my mother is diabetic. But she has a sweet tooth
6/27/22, 23:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: Did she even check
6/27/22, 23:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: She cab get checked ryt
6/27/22, 23:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 🥲
6/27/22, 23:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My father is convinced he is fine, but he has high blood glucose, but he doesn't seem to care
6/27/22, 23:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: for you?
6/27/22, 23:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: It leads to problems
6/27/22, 23:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
6/27/22, 23:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She herself is prediabetic
6/27/22, 23:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She got me checked last year and my levels were normal 🥲
6/27/22, 23:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It does, he has meds. For now I'm trying to ensure that he takes them on time
6/27/22, 23:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In my mom's case she never shows me her reports. So I don't know what is happening 🥲
6/27/22, 23:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: parent, their health and there ignorance, typical Indian behaviour, my father had a tendency to comment money wasted if a test result comes out to be negative 👀☠️🤣
6/27/22, 23:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: My father walks
6/27/22, 23:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: That helped him
6/27/22, 23:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: It was my suggestion
6/27/22, 23:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: After my weight loss
6/27/22, 23:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: His sugar levels are almost normal now
6/27/22, 23:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My father is also kind of averse to doctors. When I told him to show me all the reports he just gave me the chest xray and not what the doc wrote 🥲
Then I watched some YouTube videos on reading an xray and concluded that he has a lung infection, which was again confirmed by my brother who is an MBBS student 🥲
6/27/22, 23:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲🥲🥲
6/27/22, 23:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: Parents should take care of themselves
6/27/22, 23:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My mother is like that 🥲
She only does those tests which her office reimburses
6/27/22, 23:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: My parents do take tests
6/27/22, 23:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: Mainly cuz my mom has to
6/27/22, 23:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My Dad walks too. But we detected his just a few days back. So let's see how things progress
6/27/22, 23:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: Else she can't take her rheumatoid arthritis medicine
6/27/22, 23:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 🥲
6/27/22, 23:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: And dad gets scared cuz his father died early
6/27/22, 23:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How are your mother's legs now? Is she able to walk now?
6/27/22, 23:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
6/27/22, 23:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲
6/27/22, 23:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yep. She is taller now
6/27/22, 23:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: This is all very exciting
6/27/22, 23:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🤩
6/27/22, 23:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nice 😂
6/27/22, 23:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 23:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: I was never able to actually go on trips
6/27/22, 23:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: Cuz parents can't walk
6/27/22, 23:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: We go to garden and stand at entrance
6/27/22, 23:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh 🥲
6/27/22, 23:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: So I love going places and walking and running if possible
6/27/22, 23:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂
6/27/22, 23:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: Like in dam
6/27/22, 23:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yeah 😂
6/27/22, 23:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: Some people move in 0.25x
6/27/22, 23:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲🥲
6/27/22, 23:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: my mother has a very modern approach to tests and medicines partly because tests helped save her by early detection
6/27/22, 23:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: What did she have
6/27/22, 23:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's good. My parents especially mother are very distrustful of doctors because of some previous incidents. They always self diagnose much to my annoyance 🥲
6/27/22, 23:10 - Lekshmi R Nair: Uk I went to hospital once with Tejswati
6/27/22, 23:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My mother is becoming slower and slower and she refuses treatment. This was probably our last trip together
6/27/22, 23:10 - Lekshmi R Nair: She was amazed at hiw nice and cheap hospitals are
6/27/22, 23:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: in 2013-2014 she had breast tumour later came out to be developing cancer maybe 2 stage as i remember, later she had to be on medication for 2 years
6/27/22, 23:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh, for you or her?
6/27/22, 23:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She is all better now right?
6/27/22, 23:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: Her. She looked at welding flame and burned her retina fiber or something
6/27/22, 23:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
6/27/22, 23:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh, I remember that 🥲🥲🥲
6/27/22, 23:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Something happened to Keerthi too
6/27/22, 23:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep, she is
6/27/22, 23:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's great to know
6/27/22, 23:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 23:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My aunt (mom's sister) died of some kind of throat cancer. It was completely preventable. She ignored so many signs 
The last time I saw her she looked so frail. I knew it was going to be the last time I'll ever see her
6/27/22, 23:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *Early death was preventable
6/27/22, 23:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The situation was so grim and I felt like she too knew that I knew she won't last much longer. She passed away 5 months later. She was freed of the pain
6/27/22, 23:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i still remember then testing infected(bacterial) her tumor which developed pain which is a sign of 4th stage (as the doctor told) and scared us all as my father panicked but later it came out it happens sometimes that while using the needle to collect sample some sort of bacterial infection starts which can be cured by anti-biotic but that was one of the most frightening days of my life as the test results came in a week so we were like in a state of shock
6/27/22, 23:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh, this is the biggest problem of Indian women, self denial of own health and symptoms causing greater damage to self if survived
6/27/22, 23:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can't imagine how scary that must have been
6/27/22, 23:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And that too for a week. It's as if a dear life is swaying in front of you like a pendulum
6/27/22, 23:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I hope things get better and all parents and adults take care of their health too 🥲
6/27/22, 23:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: hmm
6/27/22, 23:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: those were bad days really bad
6/27/22, 23:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you know all around the world and even in india cancer societies recommend a self check for women, it is supposed to help detect over 50% of breast cancer cases in early stages and hence saving life and resources but no one teaches because we consider topics of health like this as taboo
6/27/22, 23:29 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yessss
6/27/22, 23:29 - Lekshmi R Nair: Self check is not taught in sex education
6/27/22, 23:29 - Lekshmi R Nair: Cuz we don't have sex ed
6/27/22, 23:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm glad it has passed and everything is fine now
6/27/22, 23:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True
6/27/22, 23:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But mammograms are sometimes expensive so mothers in order to save money skip it 🥲
6/27/22, 23:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ++
I Iearnt it on my own. They don't teach the necessary stuff
6/27/22, 23:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My school once called a doctor for sex ed. I know her well. It was an only girls session. Back then I myself didn't know much about what is supposed to be taught. But now when I look back, the session was outright terrible
6/27/22, 23:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She missed all the necessary things. She mentioned self check and breast cancer but never gave a demo or other sources to seek information from
6/27/22, 23:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She brought up things such as Ramayana and Sita and I was so confused
6/27/22, 23:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She asked us to abstain from sex until marriage without telling us what sex is 😶‍🌫️
6/27/22, 23:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/27/22, 23:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't know what happened in the boys' session. And neither did I have the guts to ask anyone
6/28/22, 00:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If given an opportunity I believe I can take a better session and I'm ready to volunteer. Just because those girls are shy doesn't mean you skip essential topics. You try to make them more comfortable 🥲
6/28/22, 00:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I discovered that a friend of mine in college knew nothing about contraception and I tried to tell her a few things. But she was so shy that she almost ran away
6/28/22, 00:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 00:02 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂😂
6/28/22, 00:02 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's nothing to be shy about
6/28/22, 00:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: U need to be educated
6/28/22, 00:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes, but this starts from school. Nobody talks about 'it' 🥲
6/28/22, 00:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: Now its more open
6/28/22, 00:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My 12th bio teacher was also talking about abstinence and I was like, talk about contraception and STDs instead 🥲
6/28/22, 00:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Hopefully so. I want to someday see the change in my school
6/28/22, 00:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And then I'll be happy
6/28/22, 00:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sadly no change at home at present. My mother is incredibly awkward, especially now that I understand things
6/28/22, 00:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: there is an emerging concept in education and health think tanks to conduct reproductive health lessons in online by people who actually want to teach things
6/28/22, 00:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's good 🤔
But those who don't have internet access? And I feel some things could be a bit hands on 🤔
6/28/22, 00:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: this would allow students to attend sessions in person or grp as they prefer and will bring uniformity across rural and urban education gap on such topics
6/28/22, 00:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 00:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yeah, that is, it is still a nascent concept gaining support after pandemic (as online boost) so a lot of factors will need to be considered and also will require political willpower due to conservative society
6/28/22, 00:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 00:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is old. But I like it
6/28/22, 00:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True
6/28/22, 00:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I learnt 95% of the things I know from the internet and that too in 2018 I guess. It isn't that long back
6/28/22, 00:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: see already people rely on online then why not giving the above idea a try
6/28/22, 00:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True. We need to teach kids how to stay safe on the internet too 🥲
6/28/22, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 00:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that's another topic and might be taught in normal classes too
6/28/22, 00:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 00:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Should be and should happen soon and start young
6/28/22, 00:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Little kids are on the internet
6/28/22, 00:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: YouTube kids is filled with some very strange creators attempting to profit out of kids watching them over and over again
6/28/22, 00:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1
6/28/22, 00:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that should be stopped
6/28/22, 00:32 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 00:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Kids below 9 should be totally moderated imo. But that brings questions on privacy and how accessible the internet has become and it's impossible to moderate them all the time
6/28/22, 00:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My father still moderates my internet use. But I've become really good at hiding 😶‍🌫️
He has thankfully left my WhatsApp alone now 😶‍🌫️
6/28/22, 10:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: what is privacy for a kid, i don't it's that much important for a kid
6/28/22, 10:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 10:21 - Lekshmi R Nair: Indian parents consider until marriage as kid
6/28/22, 10:21 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😶‍🌫😶‍🌫
6/28/22, 10:21 - Lekshmi R Nair: And I am not planning to marry anytime soon
6/28/22, 10:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: So...
6/28/22, 10:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am a kid
6/28/22, 10:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: But I need privacy
6/28/22, 10:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🫥🫥
6/28/22, 10:22 - Saamp🐍: I need privacy
6/28/22, 10:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but why? he should trust you as you wouldn't do anything obvious
6/28/22, 10:22 - Saamp🐍: Ohh nice one more child is here 😂
6/28/22, 10:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂😂😂
6/28/22, 10:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: my definition for kid <14
6/28/22, 10:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: Parents don't care
6/28/22, 10:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 10:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: frankly saying i have more privacy and have never seen my parents interfering with it for last 4-5 years
6/28/22, 10:25 - Saamp🐍: In Ayurveda there is a classification for child adult and very much adult 😂 and actually there are 3 definitions of each one of them 6 if we count gender specific seperately...

Some rishi say kid is till 14-16 (puberty) while some rishi even consider 22 year old male a kid
6/28/22, 10:25 - Saamp🐍: Ayurved*
6/28/22, 10:26 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🤔my case too since college, but i think it's mostly because they know I will flip out if they tried. Also I changed passwords. Everywhere
6/28/22, 10:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice but we need modern identifications would be more helpful as back then there was no internet and not much for the kid to ask privacy for
6/28/22, 10:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, you think they avoid such checks to avoid confrontations 👀☠️🤣 ( you seem gangster 🤣)
6/28/22, 10:28 - Saamp🐍: I actually heard a quote somewhere and I completely relate to it. It said...

My father never said yes to me for a night out. But at the same time he never really checked my phone also. Definition of being protective and giving privacy
6/28/22, 10:28 - Saamp🐍: She is😶‍🌫️ peryatale

6/28/22, 10:31 - Saamp🐍: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 10:31 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's ur mistake to make. He should trust u somewhat. What will u do when u have to depend on urself?

6/28/22, 10:33 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yesssss

6/28/22, 10:33 - Saamp🐍: But then again there's a loophole 🌝
6/28/22, 10:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Wonderla

6/28/22, 22:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh, that. I have some grudges against him 😂
6/28/22, 22:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And he sends these very abrupt texts to people

6/28/22, 22:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: themks
6/28/22, 22:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i already turned his trap down by saying what if they would do so (hence live and let em live)
6/28/22, 22:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: if i would have said yes then only 🥲
6/28/22, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I tried to help him get an e pass for coming into and leaving Kerala during April last year. The process is so easy but he still was adamant not to get the pass because someone told him it wasn't required. I know it may be not be required, but you're coming so far. Why take the risk? 🥲
6/28/22, 22:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 🤣, you must not help people more than they deserve 👀🤣
6/28/22, 22:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And then he told several others it wasn't required and others who already got the pass were confused and began questioning me
6/28/22, 22:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Then I stopped helping people. I don't know anything about Kerala. Don't ask me anything 😌

6/28/22, 22:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh demm that would have been too tough for you since they asked and then contradicted you. though whole process was online
6/28/22, 22:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not really. They later understood that it's a precautionary measure. Most of them didn't think much of it
6/28/22, 22:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is classified information. Shouldn't spill out from here

6/28/22, 22:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: he is having this issue i know of deriving unnecessary conclusions and then confronting people on them without purpose (i have witnessed)
6/28/22, 22:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: which information
6/28/22, 22:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 22:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True. This and many other incidents is why I don't really like him a lot

6/28/22, 22:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Assuming dd/mm/yyyy 🥹
6/28/22, 22:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i don't really remember might be for life sciences/economics/maths or might be completely another another reason. I never replied 👀
6/28/22, 22:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: when your whole life revolves around exams you remember the dates like birthday

6/28/22, 22:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 22:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I still remember all the dates of my 10th and 12th board exams 😶‍🌫️
6/28/22, 22:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My father was more frightened than me. Everytime I saw him after the exams, he was almost in tears
6/28/22, 22:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That was very abrupt 😂
6/28/22, 22:53 - Amritanshu Raj CR: see i knew it
6/28/22, 22:55 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh seems he is a very generous persons and get emotional for your friends whom parents will berate them by comparing with your marks😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
6/28/22, 22:55 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 22:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂😂😂
6/28/22, 22:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He was more anxious about if my friends score more than me 😂
6/28/22, 22:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You know, some of my then friends asked me to convince my father to take tuitions in all subjects. They thought that way they'll come to know of all my secrets of studying and manage to score as well
6/28/22, 22:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 23:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm that time would have been tough on him. may be because he taught you he got emotionally attached with your performance
6/28/22, 23:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My school is in a fairly rural area and there aren't many academically gifted students (they have many other talents, say music and photography, painting, yoga and other extra curriculars. These people have appeared in reality shows and are awesome.) So I never really faced much of a competition academically. After 10th standard I realized that some of them learnt everything by heart and that wasn't working anymore 🥲
So their performance dropped in free fall
6/28/22, 23:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 👀, seems a whole suspense thriller with espionage twists ☠️
6/28/22, 23:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup, he is very attached to my grades. This time I unboxed my grades before my extended family and he was so delighted that he went around showing my laptop to everyone who came 😂
6/28/22, 23:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Although to be clear, he doesn't teach me anymore. The last time he helped was for that intro to engg presentation
6/28/22, 23:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 🥲, good for you and not good for you simultaneously
6/28/22, 23:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: proud father of an academic prodigy
6/28/22, 23:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In 12th there was this girl who asked me how some maths exam went. I replied that it was so easy that I had nothing to do for over 30 minutes of the exam. And then she cried endlessly because she was going to fail in the exam 🥲
6/28/22, 23:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 23:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Until then I could never envision that something so trivial for me, integrations that were so simple that I could do in my head (they were actually very easy, just not directly ripped from the text. If you know the basic methods of integration you'll solve it in no time) would be so impossible to solve for them
6/28/22, 23:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I refuse to admit that I'm a prodigy. Prodigies are people like Terence Tao. He is simply marvellous
6/28/22, 23:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm, or anyone I know is nowhere near
6/28/22, 23:07 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yeah understandable, It would have more of a concern if you still relied on him 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
6/28/22, 23:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 23:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He is EE. I was EE. Had I still been in EE the story would have been different 😂
6/28/22, 23:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: she seemed to looking for some comfort and you destroyed her completely ☠️👀
6/28/22, 23:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But teaching standards have changed and he has largely forgotten most things not directly related to his work
6/28/22, 23:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I never intended to. She seemed quite happy before asking me. So I thought she found it easy too 🥲
6/28/22, 23:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice
6/28/22, 23:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is what happens in our education system 🥲
6/28/22, 23:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: humility 🙏 , still you more closer of being atleast a local prodigy if not anything else
6/28/22, 23:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: People learn all the textbook questions by heart and hope they come for the exams
6/28/22, 23:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I may be a local prodigy in my neighborhood 😂
6/28/22, 23:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And that did happen for a long time
6/28/22, 23:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that happens
6/28/22, 23:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 23:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's how they scored so well previously and struggled once the pattern shifted. It was really sad to see so many of my friends struggle
6/28/22, 23:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep
6/28/22, 23:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And my maths teacher in 11th and 12th didn't do justice to the subject. The students too didn't do justice to her. They would rely on their tuitions and not pay attention to anything she said in class 🥲
6/28/22, 23:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: your neighborhood extends from your home to Palakkad
6/28/22, 23:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nooooooooo
6/28/22, 23:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: @919188011081 tell him about the magnificent students you know 🥲
6/28/22, 23:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I know a lot of them too
6/28/22, 23:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In my coaching institute there were amazing folks
6/28/22, 23:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Geniuses, I bow before them
6/28/22, 23:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: problem was initial education in subcontinent was religion then literature and that method worked well on these
6/28/22, 23:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interesting. Never thought of it that way
6/28/22, 23:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: and then you refuse to acknowledge many others bow before you
6/28/22, 23:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 23:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not many though. 
Almost everyone is gifted in some way. If they aren't, they create a way
6/28/22, 23:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: just an elite league, others have irrelevant(in current scenario) interests and hobbies those can't compared to the elite league's achievements
6/28/22, 23:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Let's stop this here 🥲
At this point this group has become me boasting about my life 🥹

6/29/22, 21:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have now realized that Kerala, at least the locality where I live has a more conservative dressing sense. I could see a much more diverse range of clothes during my short stay at Dibrugarh
6/29/22, 21:52 - Lekshmi R Nair: Kerala has conservative dressing
6/29/22, 21:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The cats are the ultimate lords

6/29/22, 21:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's convenient in a way, but if we go entirely by train we prefer to stop at many places on the way for 2-3 days
6/29/22, 21:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: View from the International space station
6/29/22, 21:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Dinner time. Will talk later

6/29/22, 22:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Hello
6/29/22, 22:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/29/22, 22:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You can see the earth and crescent moon and the light of the sun. I liked the pic a lot. No other reason as to why I haven't changed it to something else for so long
6/29/22, 22:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Once I went to the local supermarket with my father to buy something. I saw a teacher there. I was wearing what I usually wear in hostel and she came and whispered to me asking why didn't I wear full pants 🥹
6/29/22, 22:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In school PT teacher would regularly check if we wore shorts. As per my mother there was no need for me to wear shorts everyday until I was in 7th standard because my petticoat was very long, just a bit shorter than my pinafore. But those teachers would catch me every week
6/29/22, 22:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I would then bring shorts in my bag and wear them before the assembly 🥹
6/29/22, 22:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Schools have weird rules in general. Some teachers has a problem with me wearing gold earrings as a kid. They asked me to replace it with a gold stud. I don't get how is a gold stud more fall proof than a gold earring?
6/29/22, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In 1st standard I had to get a written note from my parents and a doctor that wearing non gold or non silver earrings led to decaying skin (I'm allergic to those other metals)
6/29/22, 22:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: Y tf does she care🥲
6/29/22, 22:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: They check????
6/29/22, 22:58 - Lekshmi R Nair: I think it was more like that in children's case no one should pull. Otherwise fear of breaking ig? Dunno
6/29/22, 23:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yeah, that is actually pretty reasonable
6/29/22, 23:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Coz she is my teacher? 😂
Let her have a good look at my nice pretty legs 😶‍🌫️
6/29/22, 23:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In my school they did. I can understand wearing shorts to yoga and dance classes and even before PT. Otherwise it was way too hot already 🥲
6/29/22, 23:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: I also didn't use to
6/29/22, 23:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂
6/29/22, 23:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: No one checked though
6/29/22, 23:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My school had some crazy teachers. I doubt if they even have orders to check. Or were they volunteering? 🥲
6/29/22, 23:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
6/29/22, 23:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: Conservative mindset ig
6/29/22, 23:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🤔

6/29/22, 23:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True, some teachers were very friendly
6/29/22, 23:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Others were friendly but conservative
6/29/22, 23:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In school the only complaints that reached home were related to uniform, usually

6/30/22, 15:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: India is a welfare state(socialist as per preamble) and socialist states sees citizenship concept differently than other nation states. Like government will have to confer benefits to already privileged people. Also various laws won't be applicable on the person due to conflict of jurisdiction between India and the other country

Our ceiling is leaking
7/3/22, 17:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
7/3/22, 17:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And there is a floor above where nobody lives. So I'm assuming that the upper floor is flooded
7/3/22, 17:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But not sure how
7/3/22, 17:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Water is dripping into my nose. It's nice and cold and smells like whitewash
7/3/22, 17:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes to taste it
7/3/22, 17:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *Yet
7/3/22, 17:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: Flooded?
7/3/22, 17:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: Wtf
7/3/22, 17:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't think paint smelling stuff should be tasted
7/3/22, 17:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: I may be wrong.
7/3/22, 17:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because otherwise why would my ceiling be dripping? 🥲 I can understand if it was the roof above
7/3/22, 17:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: Bathroom

7/4/22, 15:02 - Saamp🐍: There are 2 possibilities  either there is an after life or there is not. Both are equally terrifying/satisfying
7/4/22, 15:03 - Saamp🐍: One quick question

7/4/22, 15:03 - Saamp🐍: He said in his last words as

7/4/22, 15:04 - Saamp🐍: Cause those were his happiest days
7/4/22, 15:04 - Saamp🐍: Similarly
7/4/22, 15:04 - Saamp🐍: If you given another life
7/4/22, 15:04 - Saamp🐍: Will you choose to become lekshmi/amritanshu/sneha again?
7/4/22, 15:05 - Saamp🐍: Become

7/4/22, 15:07 - Amritanshu Raj CR: It will depend on how my later life evolves if it does somewhat (even 30-40%) how i think then definitely i will choose to be myself again and again
7/4/22, 15:07 - Saamp🐍: No your life stops now

7/4/22, 16:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 7 in cs only others can't appear for supplementary
7/4/22, 16:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This isn't hostel. I went upstairs maybe once or twice that too in childhood. My mind was clear back that. Nothing about poking holes 😶‍🌫
7/4/22, 16:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because for others it's an elective?

7/4/22, 17:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The person whom I suspect do dearly doesn't agree to my suspicions
7/4/22, 17:41 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😶‍🌫understandable. Families usually don't gib shit about if  we have common interest.  Usually same place and income and caste
7/4/22, 17:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup 🥲
7/4/22, 17:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My family is searching for a bride for a brother and they want a quiet girl, preferably school teacher, well spoken, well dressed, nice for him
7/4/22, 17:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And all of this is opposite of me, most of it is 😶‍🌫
7/4/22, 17:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So assuming that people of my caste are searching for brides with similar qualities, I probably won't find anyone 😶‍🌫
7/4/22, 17:45 - Saamp🐍: And when they finally find

7/4/22, 17:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't want to alter my entire life after marriage

7/4/22, 17:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In mine we always do 🥲
7/4/22, 17:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: As long as they are nit in inlaws home
7/4/22, 17:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: No one lives in inlaws homes
7/4/22, 17:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Here in joint families we can't do that. My mom always has to wear Saree at her in laws place
7/4/22, 17:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: Mostly now

7/5/22, 12:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I didn't know dragons had bobs at the end of their tails
7/5/22, 12:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 12:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you cruel hearted person not tolerating a tiny, colourful and cute mushroom
7/5/22, 12:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 12:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Okay, I'll bring on of these. Plant and grow them in your hostel room 🙃
7/5/22, 12:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 12:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They'll release spores after which you'll have more of them
7/5/22, 12:45 - Amritanshu Raj CR: no you can't the mushroom choose to grow there you can't just displace it
7/5/22, 12:46 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 12:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'll bring it's spores then. They grow outside my house too
7/5/22, 12:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Perhaps you can harness some important chemical produced by it and start your own business
7/5/22, 18:07 - Amritanshu Raj CR: is it a threat or offer?
7/5/22, 18:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you are unnecessarily confusing mushrooms with poppy 👀
7/5/22, 18:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's an offer
7/5/22, 18:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh no. Mushrooms harbour mysterious chemicals. There are just so many of them that you can't have researched them all
7/5/22, 18:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's a good opportunity I would say
7/5/22, 18:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Them as in species of mushrooms
7/5/22, 18:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Try it, you'll get results
7/5/22, 18:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I actually hid it for days since I wanted it to grow fully and be certain of which species it belongs too
7/5/22, 18:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But sadly my father removed it too soon, every single time. Happened 5 times in a month and then he ended it with POP
7/5/22, 18:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: with utmost respect i would beg to decline your offer since the place is not owned by me i will need a permission from college authorities to introduce a new species for which i am currently unwilling to invest my time and resources
7/5/22, 18:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: better than poppy trade?
7/5/22, 18:32 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you may remove the pop using a hammer and let the poor thing revive 👀
7/5/22, 19:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is not an invasive species. They are within a few 100 km of each other, similar ecosystem, similar predators
7/5/22, 19:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You don't have to worry about it affecting a very stable ecosystem, that is our hostel environment
7/5/22, 19:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't deal in poppy, how would I know? But I suppose this venture will take it's time to grow and proliferate
7/5/22, 19:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't worry. Nature will reclaim it's spaces. After we leave this place everything will be restored to how it was. In fact it's already happening. The home where I've lived for 18 years of my life seems unlivable to me now. I've overcome the sentiment in favour of the people here
7/5/22, 21:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: non-invasive doesn't mean it would not be hostile to native species of hostels
7/5/22, 21:07 - Saamp🐍: @919188011081
7/5/22, 21:07 - Saamp🐍: You are not making the logo?
7/5/22, 21:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: No
7/5/22, 21:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂
7/5/22, 21:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: Photoshop sux. I realized after I tried making posters there🥲
Sux since ik shit about it...but still. And other app I use is canva. I don't think it's great for making logos
7/5/22, 21:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: Also conflict of interest
7/5/22, 21:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 21:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but it may affect still, you can't be sure about it
7/5/22, 21:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It won't be, I assure you. I've seen certain mushrooms there in certain places. I could show you those places
7/5/22, 21:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We can do a sampling test for that

7/5/22, 21:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't really know. I don't have the knowledge or know anyone with that knowledge to answer that question

7/5/22, 21:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: For exams?
7/5/22, 21:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's not in the planned structure of any building, but nature is nature, human is ...
7/5/22, 21:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: some
7/5/22, 21:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: many for innovation lab projects
7/5/22, 21:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: human is also nature?
7/5/22, 21:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Others for projects?
7/5/22, 21:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh, nice

7/5/22, 21:53 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 21:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I ate khichdi today. It was nice
7/5/22, 21:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm not that fond of biryani, especially not the one they give in mess
7/5/22, 21:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: I want paneerrrrrr
7/5/22, 21:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 21:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I prefer normal, simple food on a regular basis. Biryani should be something special, not something I want to eat 4 times a week
7/5/22, 21:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 21:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Travel by Rajdhani. They give paneer
7/5/22, 21:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The paneer actually has paneer
7/5/22, 21:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: Wow😐
7/5/22, 21:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 22:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: for a plate of paneer costing about 100 you choose 3-4k payment option 👀
7/5/22, 23:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Depends on the length of the journey 🥲
7/5/22, 23:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: From Palakkad to Tvm it'll be around a bit less than 1.2k in AC 2nd by assumption
7/6/22, 09:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: https://youtu.be/XY7QOlqirns
People are disgusting 🥲🥲
7/6/22, 09:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't particularly trust vice news but
7/6/22, 09:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's nit what they r saying but theinterviews
7/6/22, 09:55 - Lekshmi R Nair: I studied in a Christian school class 11 and 12
7/6/22, 09:55 - Lekshmi R Nair: We had a program where the people who advice comes and advices us.
7/6/22, 09:55 - Lekshmi R Nair: One Great man, had advice. Leggings are like walking naked
7/6/22, 09:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: If u wear "revealing " clothes, it's not you who get raped. It's some other women cuz they got aroused by seing you.
7/6/22, 09:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: Everyone who attended the class stayed silent.
7/6/22, 09:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: Teachers, principal agreed with it.
7/6/22, 09:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: Piece of shit human being.
7/6/22, 10:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: There were 2 day dhyanams. Where they said christ will cure homosexuality
7/6/22, 10:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: I was at shock ig at that point. Everyone was like meh, true, it's a sin. Wtf
7/6/22, 10:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
7/6/22, 10:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: Will such people be allowed into our college as well?
7/6/22, 10:36 - Saamp🐍: Idts
7/6/22, 10:36 - Saamp🐍: Any religious activity is not allowed
7/6/22, 11:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Bangladesh is in a kind of a aggressive-natured country. I fear the day when resources will be falling short due to uncontrolled population and ocean rise, we will have to deal with their violent behavior
7/6/22, 11:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: is it?
7/6/22, 11:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: this will be the case by 2050s also religious extremism is rising exponentially in the country
7/6/22, 11:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲

7/6/22, 12:57 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂 all ta do is restart the oscilloscope
7/6/22, 13:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sir actually asked us not to do that everytime. Yet, whenever we're struck and call the TA, that's what they do 😂
7/6/22, 13:28 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
7/6/22, 14:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
7/6/22, 14:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: either TAs never asked sir what to do or TAs didn't trust him
7/6/22, 14:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sir gave them instructions, but most of them were equally confused as us 🥲
7/6/22, 14:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: After doing the said expts, I tried doing something else and got a doubt, called the TA and she admitted she had no clue as to what I'm asking her
7/6/22, 14:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She said she did this stuff long ago in her Btech and didn't remember much. They didn't have any briefing before
7/6/22, 14:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: After the class Sir told the TAs to be more confident while talking to us 🥲
7/6/22, 14:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Vijay Sir was amazing. Loved the way he explains things
7/6/22, 16:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
7/6/22, 16:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 🥲

7/6/22, 16:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I left late. I put way too many things into the breadboard and took time dismantling it
7/6/22, 16:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You know, in lathe I cut my knuckles one day when I accidentally touched the machine. Bharath Sir asked the other Sir to dress my fingers up. He was trying to use one bandaid for both fingers. Bharath Sir came and scolded him in Malayalam. It was funny coz both of them were conversing very freely as I didn't understand what they were saying 😶‍🌫😶‍🌫😶‍🌫
7/6/22, 16:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, was it because you tried to experiment with various components or as you build inefficient circuits  👀
7/6/22, 16:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: imagine if they were berating you in malyalam for being careless 👀
7/6/22, 16:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Former 🥲
7/6/22, 16:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: God I love circuits
7/6/22, 16:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They did for a short while, but didn't tell me anything directly. Just to be a bit more careful next time 😂
7/6/22, 16:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: When someone berates you it's an excellent way to confirm that they think you don't know the language
7/6/22, 17:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice
7/6/22, 17:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>

7/6/22, 17:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've realized it's fun. Though I'm usually at the other end of it
7/6/22, 17:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You should try it someday
7/6/22, 17:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
7/6/22, 17:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ever been bitten by acid flies?
7/6/22, 17:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I had some mean classmates in school. They thought I couldn't understand Malayalam and used to say all mean thing about me around me and laugh about it
7/6/22, 17:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It used to upset me greatly. But then I thought, others who don't say much also probably think the same. So why not hear it...
7/6/22, 17:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Until 8th standard I was oblivious to how much people actually detested me. I could never quantify that until then
7/6/22, 18:02 - Lekshmi R Nair: I try speaking in Malayalam to u when I don't want people to understand
7/6/22, 18:02 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yukta

7/6/22, 18:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Do that one day and experience the thrill of it
7/6/22, 18:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was mean too. You've seen me. You don't need any more accounts or evidence 😂
7/6/22, 18:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Everything has balanced out
7/6/22, 18:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yes 🥲

7/12/22, 09:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Noted, cats are volatile
7/12/22, 10:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Not actually, they informed early so that's a good thing

7/12/22, 11:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup, with fungal cultures

7/12/22, 12:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I say good conditions and high growth rate
7/12/22, 12:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: For fungi of course, not humans 🥲
7/12/22, 12:03 - Saamp🐍: Humans are just roaming fungi
7/12/22, 12:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There are several factors, I don't think you can call something as being the 'most necessary'
7/12/22, 12:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nah, all fungi in a colony are connected, unlike humans
7/12/22, 12:04 - Saamp🐍: Ooioooooooooooo
7/12/22, 12:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They are very different
7/12/22, 12:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: in physical sense?
7/12/22, 12:09 - Saamp🐍: Noo then the answer will be for a living colony to establish
7/12/22, 12:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: left in open
7/12/22, 12:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: ?
7/12/22, 12:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>

7/12/22, 17:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I will sponser it
7/12/22, 17:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh no. There are cracks created by natural forces at play and water is seeping through them
7/12/22, 17:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I need your help to come up with innovative ways to mend the cracks and fix the seepage issue
7/12/22, 17:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Train number or name? I'll follow you

At least not without a missing limb or two 🥹
7/12/22, 18:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I like trains
7/12/22, 18:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But this ain't social or political humour. I'm slightly better at other kinds of humour

7/12/22, 18:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Tataaaaaa
7/12/22, 18:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Noice, still to be 100% sure: that bird loses flight power and you call it evolution

7/12/22, 18:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Once I went to H4 to say goodbye to a guy. He didn't expect me there are was so frightened that he didn't speak a word 😂
7/12/22, 18:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Just glanced at me and jumped into the taxi and left

7/12/22, 18:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Your purpose of h4 visit gone unfulfilled
7/12/22, 18:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nah, it was nice though. It was also the first time I went to H4. I was scared that the security would stop me, but he didn't

7/12/22, 20:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: “When one of ussays, ‘Look, there’s nothing out there,’ what we are really saying is, ‘Icannot see.’”
7/12/22, 20:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Deep thoughts
7/12/22, 20:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Someone missed an umbrella it seems

7/12/22, 21:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oh 😂
7/12/22, 21:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Lone

7/12/22, 21:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: On way to Assam?
7/12/22, 21:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sometimes I think she is a mini Sherlock Holmes. On our journey from Dibrugarh to Benaras she correctly deduced the occupation of the father in the family, workplace, posting, original state, the children's ages and many more 🥲
7/12/22, 21:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yess
7/12/22, 21:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: You worked in railway catering? 😂

7/12/22, 21:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: If on train
7/12/22, 21:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They had removed the curtains because of covid. Now too not every train has curtains
7/12/22, 21:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They get on the train in one station, do their work and get down in the next station
7/12/22, 21:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also we use cotton balls to secure our ears from our bug friends
7/12/22, 21:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh, my father has tendency to get dragged in political conversations. Me strictly against it
7/12/22, 21:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: But if he finds momentary joy while in a train debate I can accept it

7/12/22, 21:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's dangerous 🥹
7/12/22, 21:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
7/12/22, 21:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The last debate my father entered into was dowry, advantages and disadvantages
7/12/22, 21:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My mother usually lies when others ask us any question 😂
She will say she is a teacher in a gov primary school, I'm 2-3 years younger than what I'm and many things
7/12/22, 21:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1 my whole family except my father though he generally plays the ideal guy and pretty much keep calm

7/12/22, 21:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Noice
7/12/22, 21:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Explains migration right ?
7/12/22, 21:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Generally he is calm also when we hint him he becomes quiet but if he likes we can't control him always. Freewill
7/12/22, 21:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
7/12/22, 21:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh 😂, teacher is generally an acceptable lie from an educated Indian woman (stereotype)

7/12/22, 21:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We moved to Kerala coz father got transferred here
7/12/22, 21:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That was in 1990 or around that time
7/12/22, 21:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And then my mother moved here after marriage in 1999 or around that time
7/12/22, 21:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: HPC, Hindustan Paper Corp. had many branches, some in Assam, one in Kerala. He was initially posted in Assam but later transferred because of various reasons
7/12/22, 21:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oo, me over-simplifying things 🥲🥲🥲

7/15/22, 12:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂😂😂
7/15/22, 12:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Milk powder is more expensive that milk itself. I concluded it's some kind of flour 🥲
7/15/22, 12:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲
7/15/22, 14:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
7/15/22, 14:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The milk itself is adulterated 🥲

7/15/22, 17:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No, I realised it long back. Yet everyday I take a leap of faith and drink it
7/15/22, 17:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't know for sure, it could be a variety of things
7/15/22, 17:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: First option won't work, ever

7/15/22, 23:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I mean it's another roommate. Not comparing it to my human roommate

7/17/22, 18:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Your parents aren't very open about boyfriends, crushes etc, most Indian parents aren't
7/17/22, 18:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But canned beans is a thing too. So spilled beans works 😌
7/17/22, 18:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: Dunno
7/17/22, 18:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Neither are mine
7/17/22, 18:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If my parents know that I have a crush I don't know what will happen to me
7/17/22, 18:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They even have the capacity to remove me from hostel and make me a day scholar
7/17/22, 18:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But then my parents are okay with me having friends who are boys
7/17/22, 18:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Hand holding and touching don't seem to bother them. That's a plus point
7/17/22, 18:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
7/17/22, 18:50 - Saamp🐍: Idk how my parents feel about it
7/17/22, 18:50 - Saamp🐍: Cause I never really shared anything
7/17/22, 18:50 - Saamp🐍: But as a sarcasm I never leave a chance to convince them that I am of a suitable age and now they should find a bride for me 😂
7/17/22, 18:51 - Saamp🐍: Dunno what will happen if I'm serious 😶‍🌫️
7/17/22, 18:55 - Saamp🐍: It's been a while now

7/17/22, 19:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
7/17/22, 19:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I never complain about privileges but i never had a chance to have them participate in my life very rigorously because when i became a more aware person they were always not very calm and composed. My teen years is mostly filled with memories of my parents struggling with disease, depression(occasionally), finance .... Occasionally i have played iron pillar for them not the else way. Now they have just gave me more freedom that i can even imagine but i choose never to face everything they were facing i become more calm, more reasonable. Now it's more like i will inform them of anything and they will accept but i will never do that
7/17/22, 19:02 - Saamp🐍: I'll 😌😌
7/17/22, 19:02 - Saamp🐍: Actually recently I was thinking about it

7/17/22, 19:06 - Saamp🐍: Honestly I have less friends in college than I had in school
7/17/22, 19:07 - Saamp🐍: I'm counting those whom I'll invite to my wedding
7/17/22, 19:07 - Saamp🐍: Whom I think I wanna stay in touch after this gets over
7/17/22, 19:07 - Saamp🐍: It's kinda negative but some people here really sucks
7/17/22, 19:08 - Saamp🐍: Like a lot 😂

7/17/22, 19:10 - You changed the subject from "Club Gossips 🤭" to "Suggest a group name"
7/17/22, 19:11 - Saamp🐍: Date will be decided instantly
7/17/22, 19:11 - Saamp🐍: The girl I'll marry will be so crazy that who knows one day we both might be high and get engaged
7/17/22, 19:11 - Saamp🐍: 😂😌🥲
7/17/22, 19:11 - Saamp🐍: Finding that girl

7/17/22, 19:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that's not how it works people change some people you don't appreciate here might change with time, some people you do appreciate will not be that much active and friendship will get fainted with time.
7/17/22, 19:13 - Saamp🐍: Trueee
7/17/22, 19:13 - Saamp🐍: Let's see how it goes
7/17/22, 19:14 - Saamp🐍: I still have your name saved as amritanshu raj cr
7/17/22, 19:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver changed the subject from "Suggest a group name" to "Harsh's matrimony"
7/17/22, 19:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that's the good thing, you will have both kind of people at any place at any point of time but thing is balance makes places habitable

My parents don't express any emotion that may display their weakness and until two years back I was oblivious to everything happening around me.

7/18/22, 12:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True. But my mom is there for dinner. She believes her rotis are consistent in all times of the day
7/18/22, 12:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She makes dinner rotis
7/18/22, 12:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I make invisible rotis 😌
7/18/22, 12:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
7/18/22, 12:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: also you help in maintaining the constant demand for rotis helping them have a certain motivation towards the job of making rotis
7/18/22, 12:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True
7/18/22, 12:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: For when I'm gone they make rotis only for themselves, no motivation at all. Rotis don't taste good either 🥺

7/18/22, 21:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: An island is when a landmass is surrounded by a water body
7/18/22, 21:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What do you call it when a water body is surrounded by an landmass?
7/18/22, 21:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also beautiful time table came
7/18/22, 21:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: lake maybe but also sea like Caspian sea

7/18/22, 21:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: problem with the timetable is that it will not be followed since profs take much less classes than allotted
7/18/22, 21:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: like island (geography joke ruined)
7/18/22, 21:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: they claim till a 9-dash line demarcation in south china sea that's almost entire south china sea
7/18/22, 21:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 9-dash covers 90% to be exact
7/18/22, 21:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ruin it a bit more. If you are still patient, I still don't get it 🥲

7/18/22, 22:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No point in enquiring here. This group is for info dump. Ask somewhere else and let me know
7/18/22, 22:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Thanks in advance
7/18/22, 22:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Not yet I think might be in near future
7/18/22, 22:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nice, but the problem is... I too have to wake up
7/18/22, 22:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: For me waking up at 6:45 may be a bit too much
7/18/22, 22:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have to ensure that I sleep by 2 then

7/18/22, 22:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I can coddle with it all day 🥹
7/18/22, 22:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have a habit of leaving my door open when I sleep. Have to close it now. Laptop thefts are scary
7/18/22, 23:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We have a lot of Bengali professors
7/18/22, 23:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And many Bengali PG students
7/18/22, 23:54 - Saamp🐍: Maybe that's what bengalis do
7/18/22, 23:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yet I've not heard much Bengali in campus
7/18/22, 23:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What do they do?
7/18/22, 23:54 - Saamp🐍: They become professor
7/18/22, 23:54 - Saamp🐍: Or pg stydents
7/18/22, 23:54 - Saamp🐍: 😂
7/18/22, 23:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
7/18/22, 23:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The PGs are rough
7/18/22, 23:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've seen them in mess
7/18/22, 23:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They can be very unruly when it comes to rules. I have sat with some of them on one occasion and they didn't realise I know Bangla
7/18/22, 23:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😶‍🌫️
7/18/22, 23:57 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
7/18/22, 23:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Once a cousin of mine told me my Bangla accent is weird. It has a very English tinge to it. Usually for any language I know when I'm not pronouncing the words right, even for Malayalam
7/18/22, 23:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But it's sad if I can't identify it for Bangla, my own mother tongues 🥲
7/18/22, 23:58 - Saamp🐍: What you guys speak at home?
7/18/22, 23:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Although my parents say I pronounce everything fine and I too internally believe so. But I have no way to verify if it's actually true
7/18/22, 23:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Bangla
7/19/22, 00:01 - Saamp🐍: Niceee
7/19/22, 00:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: buy a stuffed toy, cat won't let you sleep
7/19/22, 00:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: cat cuddles only when it needs and not when you need
7/19/22, 00:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: keep google meet on with camera and recording on and when the thief will end the meet the footage will automatically get uploaded to drive and you can catch the thief

7/19/22, 00:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1
7/19/22, 00:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: maybe smoking majority of Bengalis i met/noticed were smokers(cigarettes)
7/19/22, 00:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: just a quick observation nothing personal 👀
7/19/22, 00:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have many at home. Parents won't let me take them to college 🥺
7/19/22, 00:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They think people will laugh at me
7/19/22, 00:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh, no. Coddle means to pamper it
7/19/22, 00:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Hehe. Thief can go to my drive and delete it if I'm signed into my account at the time of theft
7/19/22, 00:35 - Saamp🐍: Doesn't all the girls have it?
7/19/22, 00:35 - Saamp🐍: In hostel
7/19/22, 00:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interesting. One thing I noticed is that Assamese smoke much more. It's an indirect observation coz my parents aren't bothered by the smoke at all. It's normal to them. Can't even detect it sometimes. Meanwhile my nose starts ringing bells at any hint of cigarette smoke. I can't tolerate it at all
7/19/22, 00:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've not entered every room to know. 😂
7/19/22, 00:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I just know that nobody has it
7/19/22, 00:37 - Saamp🐍: Why not
7/19/22, 00:37 - Saamp🐍: I thought girls are like that
7/19/22, 00:38 - Saamp🐍: Hug their stuff animal...
7/19/22, 00:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What's so girly about having a stuff toy? 😶‍🌫️

7/19/22, 00:38 - Saamp🐍: Go sleep with them
7/19/22, 00:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't think anybody bothers about that 😂
7/19/22, 00:38 - Saamp🐍: 😂
7/19/22, 00:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Usually people have friends to talk to
7/19/22, 00:38 - Saamp🐍: Well that's what movies have taught me
7/19/22, 00:38 - Saamp🐍: Nooo

7/19/22, 00:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interesting
7/19/22, 00:38 - Saamp🐍: When you're really missing someone
7/19/22, 00:39 - Saamp🐍: You can't hug everyone
7/19/22, 00:39 - Saamp🐍: So you just hug your toy
7/19/22, 00:39 - Saamp🐍: And cry yourself to sleeo
7/19/22, 00:39 - Saamp🐍: Sleep
7/19/22, 00:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have lots of stuff toys. But I don't really hug them
7/19/22, 00:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's actually sad 🥲
7/19/22, 00:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I hug my parents. Thankfully they are there
7/19/22, 00:39 - Saamp🐍: There is actually a song I copied that line from there
7/19/22, 00:40 - Saamp🐍: Last night, I cried myself to sleeo along with the thunders and lightning
7/19/22, 00:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In college I hug my side pillow. I can't sleep without it. You can say that is my stuffed toy
7/19/22, 00:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh
7/19/22, 00:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's nice
7/19/22, 00:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yesterday my parents lectured to me about not taking good care of my sleep pillow
7/19/22, 00:42 - Saamp🐍: Why not
7/19/22, 00:42 - Saamp🐍: @919205513216 got any stuffed toys?
7/19/22, 00:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I am supposed to use two pillow covers per pillow and one towel to wrap it. The cotton is special. The pillow is very old and must be preserved
7/19/22, 00:43 - Saamp🐍: Idk why it seems offending to ask that to a guy
7/19/22, 00:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I didn't even seen your message up here 😂
7/19/22, 00:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It actually does
7/19/22, 00:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's why I didn't ask you
7/19/22, 00:43 - Saamp🐍: Ask me
7/19/22, 00:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Okay

7/19/22, 00:44 - Saamp🐍: Lekshmiji <<<<<<<<
7/19/22, 00:44 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
7/19/22, 00:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Will you be able to keep it in view of your friends?
7/19/22, 00:45 - Saamp🐍: I honestly don't care what people think of me so I can actually but I don't think I want to...

7/19/22, 00:48 - Saamp🐍: That's why I also shared the procedure 😌
7/19/22, 00:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: take a stuffed toy do a bisection remove the inside material, hide the hollow skin in your bag, come to campus fill the skin with cotton from your pillow, stitch the toy and pillow if it is still fluffy, if not ask your parents to buy new pillow
7/19/22, 00:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So cuteeee

7/19/22, 00:50 - Saamp🐍: Why
7/19/22, 00:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: They look creepy
7/19/22, 00:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: And my little sister took it's eyes and nose out
7/19/22, 00:50 - Saamp🐍: Fffffffffff
7/19/22, 00:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🫠🫠
7/19/22, 00:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Can't destroy the pillow. Pillow is my mom's life. The pillow I use has ancient cotton. It's older than me. My pillows are handmade and are passed down the generations
7/19/22, 00:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Each pillow has a story to tell
7/19/22, 00:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: His sis
7/19/22, 00:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
7/19/22, 00:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I had a small cat whom I did some beauty work on
7/19/22, 00:53 - Amritanshu Raj CR: health issues (fungus, allergy )?
7/19/22, 00:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My mother once bought me a dog I hated because it was ugly. It had broken spectacles and I kind of saw myself in it. It was my ugliest toy and I hated it. But now I like it more
7/19/22, 00:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: ask them you need a new pillow and do the operation on new pillow
7/19/22, 00:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nono 😂
We have a thing of making our own pillows and mattresses with handpicked cotton. I don't know why but it's in the family. Every 15 years my mother and father change the pillows (matlab take the cotton out and give them new bodies)
7/19/22, 00:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
7/19/22, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
7/19/22, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How can I remove the insides of my own toy. It has life given birth by my sentiments 🥲
7/19/22, 00:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, even the other way it would have been good for immunization from a series of allergies 👀🤣
7/19/22, 00:57 - Amritanshu Raj CR: then save some money and order one from the hostel
7/19/22, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's also true. Pillows are handcrafted for the sleeper. I like thin pillows. My pillows are incredibly thin. Nobody likes them 😂
7/19/22, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I like those kind of pillows. My Father's pillows are a bit thicker
7/19/22, 00:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I remember how 10 years ago my mother brought a lot of cotton back from Assam to make some good pillows
7/19/22, 00:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
7/19/22, 00:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have my stuffed toy, Lekshmi 😶‍🌫️
7/19/22, 00:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That sounds cheesy
7/19/22, 00:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I take it back
7/19/22, 01:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: smart, keeping things secured
7/19/22, 01:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
7/19/22, 01:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: so your current pillow have 10 yr old cotton from Assam?
7/19/22, 01:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My side pillow is good enough to be called a stuff toy. It has recently been given a new body. The cotton is over 25 years old
7/19/22, 01:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Mixture actually. 10 year old cotton, 20, 25 and so on
7/19/22, 01:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My mom mixed some of the cotton. That's not recommended though
7/19/22, 01:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: side pillow?
7/19/22, 01:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Basically it was my grandmothers side pillow back when she was alive
7/19/22, 01:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: alloys 🤣

7/25/22, 22:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What about for those people for whom it doesn't matter. A murderer who killed an old lady with no other kin is to be hanged. The murderer has a huge family to support. Death would be catastrophic for the family's future whereas nobody was affected from the lady's passing
7/25/22, 22:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You know, kingfisher airlines had great service and good keg space

7/26/22, 00:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: He died like someone
7/26/22, 08:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Do you want to do it as a live performance? Or recorded?
7/26/22, 08:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't know many stories, but I will search

time, except with express permission from the Warden. Similarly, fresher students are not
permitted to visit hostels of senior students. The responsibility for ensuring the above
instructions will be of the security guard/guards on duty at the entry points to the freshers'
hostels.

If you feel like you can contribute to the building of this brochure by being a part of either the design team or the content creation team, do fill the form below before tomorrow (6/8/22) night.

8/10/22, 21:58 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am stressed
8/10/22, 21:58 - Lekshmi R Nair: Can't imagine during classes
8/10/22, 21:58 - Saamp🐍: It's okay dude
8/10/22, 21:58 - Saamp🐍: You're doing a really great work
8/10/22, 21:59 - Saamp🐍: It's tough to get things done
8/10/22, 21:59 - Saamp🐍: But don't take too much pressure
8/10/22, 21:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: I shouldn't be the one working this much
8/10/22, 21:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ik
8/10/22, 21:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: But
8/10/22, 21:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😭
8/10/22, 21:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Make a list of bare minimum you need to do at the moment. Prioritise works and do only what asked, more can be done later when you feel good
8/10/22, 21:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: I need a script
8/10/22, 21:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: For independence day
8/10/22, 21:59 - Saamp🐍: And honestly you don't "have to" do anything.... Do till you like then chill for a bit then again chill
8/10/22, 21:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't want to write it
8/10/22, 21:59 - Saamp🐍: Then don't
8/10/22, 22:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: You doing good, no need to feel stressed
8/10/22, 22:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1
8/10/22, 22:01 - Saamp🐍: Curtain call is a "student" club. It'll work if students are interested and enthusiastic.... You don't have any responsibility
8/10/22, 22:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: I can't get scriptwriters to write. Will I end up doing a monolog with me acting? Shit
8/10/22, 22:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
8/10/22, 22:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: It doesn't seem so
8/10/22, 22:01 - Saamp🐍: Nice paradox
8/10/22, 22:01 - Saamp🐍: Ummm listen to this
8/10/22, 22:01 - Saamp🐍: And tell me if you agree
8/10/22, 22:01 - Saamp🐍: Ok?
8/10/22, 22:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ok
8/10/22, 22:01 - Saamp🐍: Umm
8/10/22, 22:02 - Saamp🐍: Let's say curtain call had really enthusiastic members they did a drama
8/10/22, 22:02 - Saamp🐍: Really good
8/10/22, 22:02 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yeah
8/10/22, 22:02 - Saamp🐍: Everyone approciated
8/10/22, 22:02 - Saamp🐍: Appri*
8/10/22, 22:02 - Saamp🐍: Now after one drama
8/10/22, 22:02 - Saamp🐍: Students dispersed
8/10/22, 22:03 - Saamp🐍: So they're not coming in the meetings not doing any work
8/10/22, 22:03 - Saamp🐍: It became ded
8/10/22, 22:03 - Saamp🐍: Is it your fault
8/10/22, 22:03 - Saamp🐍: No.....
8/10/22, 22:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yes?
8/10/22, 22:03 - Saamp🐍: Again someday some enthusiastic people will come together and again do something
8/10/22, 22:03 - Saamp🐍: Noooooooo
8/10/22, 22:04 - Saamp🐍: If you're lucky they'll come in your tenure
8/10/22, 22:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: I should have been more capable enough to bring people together
8/10/22, 22:04 - Saamp🐍: If not then they'll come in next head tenures
8/10/22, 22:04 - Saamp🐍: Well on paper yes but in reality no....
8/10/22, 22:04 - Saamp🐍: See
8/10/22, 22:04 - Saamp🐍: What I'm about to say
8/10/22, 22:04 - Saamp🐍: Might seem selfish
8/10/22, 22:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: Utkarsh bhaiyya has done street plays.  Sughandhan dunno what he did. But I need to do something
8/10/22, 22:04 - Saamp🐍: But that's the fact
8/10/22, 22:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
8/10/22, 22:05 - Saamp🐍: See
8/10/22, 22:05 - Saamp🐍: There are 2 possibilities
8/10/22, 22:05 - Saamp🐍: Why did you stand for head position?
8/10/22, 22:05 - Saamp🐍: 1) you wanted por
8/10/22, 22:05 - Saamp🐍: 2) you wanted to work as a drama club head and make the club better
8/10/22, 22:05 - Saamp🐍: In either case
8/10/22, 22:05 - Saamp🐍: Or 3rd you enjoy doing it
8/10/22, 22:06 - Saamp🐍: In either case
8/10/22, 22:06 - Saamp🐍: Let's do case wise
8/10/22, 22:06 - Saamp🐍: If it's first then no problem if club goes to hell
8/10/22, 22:06 - Saamp🐍: People will talk no matter what you do
8/10/22, 22:06 - Saamp🐍: You got your por
8/10/22, 22:06 - Saamp🐍: Done.
8/10/22, 22:07 - Saamp🐍: In 2nd possibility
8/10/22, 22:07 - Saamp🐍: You did everything you could you tried and trust me you've done a great job till now
8/10/22, 22:07 - Saamp🐍: No need to worry
8/10/22, 22:07 - Saamp🐍: And you'll continue to do so
8/10/22, 22:07 - Saamp🐍: I'm not just saying this
8/10/22, 22:07 - Saamp🐍: I mean it
8/10/22, 22:07 - Saamp🐍: Even amritanshu and sneha can confirm
8/10/22, 22:08 - Saamp🐍: So don't worry if you can't even do anything for independence day
8/10/22, 22:08 - Saamp🐍: That's okay.
8/10/22, 22:08 - Saamp🐍: Don't worry too much
8/10/22, 22:08 - Saamp🐍: You're a great head
8/10/22, 22:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: 3) It was the club that was most active to me during second year, and I liked the online part.
8/10/22, 22:08 - Saamp🐍: And the 3rd possibility
8/10/22, 22:08 - Saamp🐍: If you became head cause you like it enjoy blah blah
8/10/22, 22:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: Tbh that's a nice way to look at things
8/10/22, 22:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😭
8/10/22, 22:09 - Saamp🐍: And if you are worrying this much
8/10/22, 22:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: Nah
8/10/22, 22:09 - Saamp🐍: Then completely you're doing it the wrong way
8/10/22, 22:09 - Saamp🐍: Look at me
8/10/22, 22:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: You are good at inspiring motivational speeches
8/10/22, 22:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
8/10/22, 22:10 - Saamp🐍: I did a great job with EBSB and honestly it was easy cause I got the right people at the right time then after becoming akshar head I didn't do anything for 3 months
8/10/22, 22:10 - Saamp🐍: Sai prakash said a lot of shit
8/10/22, 22:10 - Saamp🐍: Did it bother me
8/10/22, 22:10 - Saamp🐍: Well at once
8/10/22, 22:10 - Saamp🐍: But do I care no 😂

8/10/22, 22:13 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
8/10/22, 22:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: Curtain call needs an event at independence day. Preferably stage play.
8/10/22, 22:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: So.....we need a script
8/10/22, 22:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: In like a day
8/10/22, 22:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: I had a scriptwriter
8/10/22, 22:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: Bit... he didn't give
8/10/22, 22:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: And ghosted me
8/10/22, 22:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
8/10/22, 22:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: I messaged all scriptwriters
8/10/22, 22:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: Let's see
8/10/22, 22:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: In 1 or 2 days
8/10/22, 22:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: Or I will possibly do a monolog
8/10/22, 22:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am starting to realize I can do crying roles
8/10/22, 22:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: Pretty easily
8/10/22, 22:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Being a club head comes with its ups and downs. There will be people totally disinterested in the things you love but occasionally you'll find people like you that will make things work
8/10/22, 22:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: +1
8/10/22, 22:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: +1
Harsh told me this when I thought of leaving EBSB at one point
8/10/22, 22:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: I want to make a webseries. On someone dying. Murder mystery
8/10/22, 22:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥺
8/10/22, 22:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't wanna do stage stuff necessarily
8/10/22, 22:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
8/10/22, 22:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: Online I didn't even know about this. I bit more than I could chew
8/10/22, 22:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No, it's not your job. The club will run itself. You're not an engine. You're the station master
8/10/22, 22:20 - Saamp🐍: I'll see what I can do
8/10/22, 22:20 - Saamp🐍: Btw
8/10/22, 22:20 - Saamp🐍: I'm doing speech
8/10/22, 22:21 - Saamp🐍: Event is on 15
8/10/22, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't pressurize yourself with what others did. Your smaller events also count. And bringing everything offline after this online sem will take time
8/10/22, 22:21 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ooo
8/10/22, 22:21 - Saamp🐍: I'll reach on 12th
8/10/22, 22:21 - Saamp🐍: Sk
8/10/22, 22:21 - Saamp🐍: Sooooo
8/10/22, 22:21 - Saamp🐍: I'll figure out everything after 12th
8/10/22, 22:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1
8/10/22, 22:21 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
8/10/22, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: +++
8/10/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
8/10/22, 22:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We'll need a team of scriptwriters then
8/10/22, 22:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I guess 1st offline event after by CC (workshop).  Listen (@919188011081 ) things aren't as back then you did good, you revived the club. Don't over burden yourself. You did great, you are doing great and you will continue doing so, don't burn out yourself over this look at larger picture
8/10/22, 22:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Message in the curtain call group. Everyone can contribute to ideas
8/10/22, 22:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: *after lockdown period
8/10/22, 22:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In school annual day we did lots of patriotic events
8/10/22, 22:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'll try to remember some of them
8/10/22, 22:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The most recent one was a tableau reenacting events from history with a narrator narrating it in a soothing voice. But too many costumes and props
8/10/22, 22:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Another one I remember was showing diversity. People dressing up in traditional clothes of various parts of India and some song which I don't remember
8/10/22, 22:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But this sounds like something sync to beat would do and again costumes
8/10/22, 22:33 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yeahh. Thats the problem with most ideas
8/10/22, 22:33 - Lekshmi R Nair: Thanks
8/10/22, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You could renact a historical conference or meeting of some sort
8/10/22, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Some meeting where some important decision was made
8/10/22, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's a bunch of people sitting and talking
8/10/22, 22:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: For example some meeting of the constitution committee where something big happened
8/10/22, 22:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Provided historical sources are available
8/10/22, 22:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://indiankanoon.org/doc/548244/
8/10/22, 22:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Something like this, not this
8/10/22, 22:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I would also like to see some club conduct a model Parliament 😶‍🌫️
8/10/22, 22:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: That would be akshar
8/10/22, 22:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1234021/
8/10/22, 22:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Check this out. I think this is about Hindi not being our national language debate
8/10/22, 22:52 - Lekshmi R Nair: That's the thing. I could go research find an idea, write and all. But tbh I don't want to do it🥲 I have scriptwriters in the club. They should be the ones writing, not me🥲🥲🥲
8/10/22, 22:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Tell me, what would happen if curtain call doesn't do anything this independence day?
8/10/22, 22:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Hence the cloud face 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
8/10/22, 22:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: Some seniors may message me and say shit?
8/10/22, 22:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: This is actually really interesting
8/10/22, 22:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🫢🫢🫢🫢

9/1/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not sure about its reception among others 😶‍🌫️
9/2/22, 00:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oo, omk, I read somewhere former Kenyan pm was impressed from Aauryavedic treatment in Kerala and wanted to bring to his country
9/2/22, 00:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yep
9/2/22, 00:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: My mami is an Ayurvedic doctor
9/2/22, 00:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: She is gifted 🤔
9/2/22, 00:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: Like she cured a lady who was in her deathbed due to allopathic medicine
9/2/22, 00:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: Dunno how
9/2/22, 00:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: The Ayurveda thing is more like resorts with massages and all
9/2/22, 00:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: You can search them up more than keralites knowing
9/2/22, 00:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I just looked it up. That hospital is some 40 min distance from my house
9/2/22, 00:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Actually my uncle asked me to look after such facility (for my aunt). She is facing neurological failure I guess and allopath docs have refused now

This one right?
9/2/22, 00:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Hospitals part is tricky as he himself was CMO in Malaria dept in Bihar, so I think and have seen, he have exhausted all allopathic possible options. (This is some sort of last resort to help her at least prevent from further damage). She is not able to walk, eat... on own due to her condition
9/2/22, 00:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Yep
9/2/22, 01:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's really severe. You all should act soon

9/3/22, 10:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: There are many people that I see in front me, that I don’t know... Maybe because I am preoccupied with the people I consider mine based on state language or anything that we see as common... But spirit of Onam is about togetherness and unity. Why don't we

That you have to make sure that you justify it because you are the secretary

Same thing cannot happen for inter iit right just because  people didn't show interest, we are here to communicate with them and make them an understand the importance of it because many other people who trusted u are attached to the same string
9/5/22, 10:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
9/5/22, 10:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: I hate curtain Call
9/5/22, 10:54 - Saamp🐍: Me not as a secretary
9/5/22, 10:54 - Saamp🐍: <Media omitted>
9/5/22, 10:55 - Saamp🐍: Is class over?
9/5/22, 10:55 - Lekshmi R Nair: Nah
9/5/22, 10:56 - Saamp🐍: Okii
9/5/22, 10:56 - Saamp🐍: Btw what's the background story
9/5/22, 10:56 - Saamp🐍: It's kinda out of the blue
9/5/22, 10:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
9/5/22, 10:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
9/5/22, 10:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: Over now
9/5/22, 11:00 - Saamp🐍: I agree with you
9/5/22, 11:00 - Saamp🐍: It's a student club
9/5/22, 11:00 - Saamp🐍: If students are not interested nothing can be done
9/5/22, 11:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
9/5/22, 11:12 - Saamp🐍: He did blame the circumstances last year
9/5/22, 11:12 - Saamp🐍: Two faced
9/5/22, 11:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What will happen to Akshar now?
9/5/22, 11:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Which drama is he talking about?
9/5/22, 11:53 - Saamp🐍: Who knows
9/5/22, 11:54 - Saamp🐍: I doubt if he can find someone who's ready to take responsibility
9/5/22, 11:54 - Saamp🐍: As last year no one was there
9/5/22, 11:54 - Saamp🐍: Maybe ayush
9/5/22, 11:55 - Lekshmi R Nair: Teachers day
9/5/22, 11:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
9/5/22, 12:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
9/5/22, 12:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This time he'll desperately try to do something because of inter IIT
9/5/22, 12:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They don't deserve a drama. No teacher would eat without their students
9/5/22, 12:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
9/5/22, 12:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Gib sadya, then we'll think of drama
9/5/22, 12:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And do thy celebrate students day?
9/5/22, 12:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Or children's day (although we aren't kimds)
9/5/22, 12:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But students day makes more sense. They can organize a drama for us
9/5/22, 12:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Probably he is planning to split Akshar into sections like debate, writing etc...
9/5/22, 12:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
9/5/22, 12:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I will resign from the core team if he gives a herculean rask
9/5/22, 12:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *task
9/5/22, 12:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
9/5/22, 12:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Btw, @919205513216 if you go to the book exhibition and you like the range of books they have there, let me know 😶‍🌫️
9/5/22, 12:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
9/5/22, 12:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Omk, i'm planning to go, am in lab rightnow 🥲
9/5/22, 12:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Okay, study 😌
9/5/22, 12:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: I think there's a lot of misunderstanding and misinterpretation here. 

And I personally know you and understand what you're saying and would like to support you where ever possible but we both are two individuals with different mind sets and thus these sort of clashes are very likely. Let's sit together and  resolve these by dialogue and reach a middle ground else nothing will happen. 

Till then just leave about all these things
9/5/22, 12:51 - Saamp🐍: 🤌
9/5/22, 14:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
9/6/22, 12:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Demm, that's like Chinese statement on India-China border issue that we will resolve it through dialogue
9/6/22, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: He is kinda forcing dialog
9/6/22, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: I have to meet him today
9/6/22, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: He asked if I am free
9/6/22, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: I said labs
9/6/22, 12:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: But then he said after dinner
9/6/22, 12:02 - Saamp🐍: Say you have to study
9/6/22, 12:02 - Saamp🐍: <Media omitted>
9/6/22, 12:02 - Lekshmi R Nair: He said few minutes
9/6/22, 12:02 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🫠🫠🫠
9/6/22, 12:02 - Saamp🐍: Say you have 2 mins
9/6/22, 12:02 - Saamp🐍: Leave after 2 mins 😂
9/6/22, 12:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Akshar will be divided into two parts one will be oratory which will be more active and will see prep for inter iit will be headed by Ayush and other writing events which will fall on me 🥲. I refused to become head citing lack of time so he came up with this new plan
9/6/22, 12:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: He will float this idea to Faculty incharge
9/6/22, 12:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
9/6/22, 12:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: Oo
9/6/22, 12:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Ahailya nila ?
9/6/22, 12:06 - Saamp🐍: Every cell of my body wants it to fail
9/6/22, 12:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ahalia
9/6/22, 12:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: Understandable
9/6/22, 12:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: The second is in proposal stage only and will depend upon Fa approval. His main focus is to perform well in inter Iit. Writing part was ok with me as I won't have to do any diff, I was already seeing writing sec under your tenure. This experiment has very less chances to succeed in my opinion
9/6/22, 12:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: But I didn't say anything otherwise he would have forced me to see both the sections, in which I didn't want to get trapped
9/6/22, 12:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You can still say no right? 🥲
9/6/22, 12:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Harsh and Sai Prakesh have to encounter each other every linguistics class
9/6/22, 17:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: He will call again, so will have a chance. though mp it will not be approved from FA itself
9/6/22, 17:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
9/6/22, 18:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And FA is?
9/6/22, 18:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>

9/6/22, 18:49 - Saamp🐍: 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
9/6/22, 18:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, you doing plot twist 😂

9/6/22, 18:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: @919188011081 get armed with ducks when you meet him. We'll release them all at once
9/6/22, 18:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's a triangle with Akshar itself being central to all of this
9/6/22, 19:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This story will be a bestseller if written well
9/6/22, 19:01 - Saamp🐍: You write

9/6/22, 19:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Two people eyeing each other, sparks flying, the world watching in silence. Yes, this is the grand story of Akshar.
9/6/22, 19:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥺🥺🥺
9/6/22, 19:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Demm
9/6/22, 19:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Now EBSB too is drowning

9/6/22, 19:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: We conducted real events and now its mostly a virtual existing club
9/6/22, 19:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It got ugly pretty soon. Those watching found it distasteful. But unbeknownst to them it was blossoming into something gargantuan
9/6/22, 19:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲
9/6/22, 19:07 - Amritanshu Raj CR: There is nothing grand in it, it will prove a disaster
9/6/22, 19:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh, didn't know you left it 🥲
9/6/22, 19:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
9/6/22, 19:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In the future someone will revive it
9/6/22, 19:08 - Saamp🐍: If lekshmi also leave cultural council it'll be a great story

4 people who doesn't know eachother came together and revived a unknown club and made it the best club and then all 4 suddenly disappeared 😶‍🌫️
9/6/22, 19:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
9/6/22, 19:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Akshar conducted events , I don't recall any events by EBSB this year

9/6/22, 19:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
9/6/22, 19:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: The environment there was welcoming under Harsh's tenure. It had a promising future then
9/6/22, 19:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup. Harsh makes everything lively. After he left I don't feel that warmth anymore 🥲
9/6/22, 19:16 - Saamp🐍: Shouldn't be under sports?

9/7/22, 09:37 - Saamp🐍: They're not online that's why
9/7/22, 12:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I sit in the first bench, can't use phone 🥲
9/7/22, 12:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also Sandeep Sir writes in small letters, can't see from too further away
9/7/22, 12:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But the chechi sitting with me in ToC class was continuously using her phone 🥲
9/7/22, 12:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Poor Sir
9/7/22, 12:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: I also was🥲
But I had my reasons

9/7/22, 12:19 - Saamp🐍: I wanna go home
9/7/22, 12:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't like maam's style of teaching. I'm not learning how much I would like to. There are many things she misses and it will only give me half baked knowledge
9/7/22, 12:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Moreover I'm very nervous through her class, you could say I'm scared of her because her way of teaching doesn't go well with me
9/7/22, 12:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Labs are handled by ckn Sir. So they are awesome

9/7/22, 16:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We brought her here, but the TTE shooed her away 😭
9/7/22, 22:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Dear Students @Ahalia Hostels,
It has been found that one of the Access points kept in a class room (Academic Block) was damaged by the students recently. In another incident, the students have removed the access point from the installed location to a different location in Hostel 4. They have used self-adhesive tapes to fix the Access Points on the wall ! Had the access point not been removed by our duty staff, that would also have been damaged.
Quite interestingly, a ticket was raised today complaining that the access point was removed !

Such practices would not help us in any way to provide better services. Hence, we request you to abstain from such activities and instead raise  tickets in the support portal if there are any issues.

The loss to the Institute will be restituted from the students involved in these cases.


Assuring you of our best services at all times...

Thanks,
With Regards,
Team CET
9/7/22, 22:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: @919499725866 please throw some light into the second incident 😂
9/7/22, 22:22 - Saamp🐍: Dunno 😂
9/7/22, 22:22 - Saamp🐍: Need to ask someone
9/7/22, 22:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Please do and let us know 😶‍🌫️
9/7/22, 22:36 - Saamp🐍: Oki
9/8/22, 19:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So for the events the plan I have in mind is... We'll announce the events with a mail that would also be educative towards the colour coding of the dustbins.
9/8/22, 19:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: then we'll have three competitions, namely
9/8/22, 19:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: a quic in collab with the quiz club, a poster making competition in collab with grafica
9/8/22, 19:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: and a slogan writing competition/ essay writing (i think the first would be better) competition in collab with akshar
9/8/22, 19:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: apart from that i'll be giving some work regarding the same to you guys soon
9/8/22, 19:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Everything is a collab 😶‍🌫
9/8/22, 19:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Me say no to too much work

9/9/22, 21:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
9/9/22, 21:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You're promoting violence
9/9/22, 21:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You shall be reported
9/9/22, 21:45 - Lekshmi R Nair: Hey everyone 

Hope you're safe and doing well. We will have a new structure for Akshar from here on, basically there will be two secretary level candidates one for Writing and one for Oratory/speaking followed by two deputy secretaries and the core team. This process will take anywhere between 3 to 7 days to finish as the constitution has to be amended to do so. Once that is done, I will officially call for nominations for the new positions. 

Till then Ayush Upadhyay will be standing secretary until the above mentioned  process will be completed (may take about a week at max)
9/9/22, 21:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Constitution has to be amended? 😂
9/9/22, 21:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's interesting. We can do whatever we wish, just have to amend the constitution first. How difficult is that process?
9/9/22, 21:54 - Saamp🐍: +1
9/9/22, 21:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Nope, me selling mrf bats
9/9/22, 21:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: You interfering in my business
9/9/22, 21:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
9/9/22, 22:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: We had a 'constitution' in first place? 🤣
9/9/22, 22:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: MRF bats have a different purpose and it's evident the advertisement isn't using it for that
9/9/22, 22:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Some people just like to watch small businesses fail
9/9/22, 22:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes, refer SAC website, my dearest SAC editor 😶‍🌫
9/9/22, 22:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I read some of it and then got bored
9/9/22, 22:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Did any of you EBSB core members get any work lately? 😶‍🌫
9/9/22, 22:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Or am I the only one
9/9/22, 22:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: Don't want work

9/9/22, 23:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And she will help me do them
9/9/22, 23:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I know how to evade plag

9/9/22, 23:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The time I invest to awaken her before classes is a good lumpsum now
9/9/22, 23:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yukta is now there 😂

9/11/22, 10:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Everywhere I see Queen Elizabeth "died"
9/11/22, 10:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I remember my teacher once asked me about my grandparents, I said they "died". She in turn told me it's not polite to say that
9/11/22, 11:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ikkk ryt
9/11/22, 11:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: Passed away is more respectful
9/11/22, 11:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: An animal dies
9/11/22, 11:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: People pass away
9/11/22, 11:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: Atleast when saying in Malayalam
9/11/22, 11:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's like chathu and antharichu in Malayalam if u get me @919447744790
9/11/22, 11:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: Maybe English is more relaxed language
9/11/22, 11:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: Or if it's a nameless or group of people, u say ded ig
9/11/22, 11:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ded doesn't have respect that comes with her perceived status
9/12/22, 11:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Or is the difference of meaning between died and passed away a personal contribution of our language use, us Indians?
9/14/22, 18:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: https://twitter.com/i/status/1569802101525446659
9/14/22, 18:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Died is ok, Passed away is also ok though people think passed away is more sensitive and delicate way to inform someone is dead

10/5/22, 13:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Rayon gives me itch

10/5/22, 13:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: All my clothes are over 70% cotton 😂

10/8/22, 13:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I'm scared. I haven't written anything in years and what I write spends on the mood

10/10/22, 19:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Astronomy club died in the womb
10/10/22, 20:52 - Saamp🐍: 🥲🥲
10/10/22, 20:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: What
10/10/22, 20:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't write this
10/10/22, 20:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
10/10/22, 20:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Then who gave the draft from CC?
10/10/22, 20:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I thought club heads were supposed to
10/10/22, 22:43 - Saamp🐍: You'll write next year

10/10/22, 23:07 - Saamp🐍: Yet I'm the one they wanna fire
10/10/22, 23:07 - Saamp🐍: Kick out

10/10/22, 23:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not thik 🥲
10/10/22, 23:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Both of them have works under your tenure. It's unfortunate but also says how disillusions of some may force competent people out from the system leading to widespread ineffectiveness in a perfectly fine system

10/11/22, 00:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Many hi fi sentences, but I agree

10/11/22, 00:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How is the play going?
10/11/22, 00:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲
10/11/22, 00:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Are people practicing?
10/11/22, 00:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: I hate them
10/11/22, 00:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You need to hold more live sessions
10/11/22, 00:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: These zoom ones don't give proper feel
10/11/22, 00:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The actors themselves may panic during the actual play otherwise 🥲
10/11/22, 00:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: One of the member came 1.20 late
10/11/22, 00:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: Then another lady is like it will mess up my beauty sleep
10/11/22, 00:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: Wtf
10/11/22, 00:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: Do you think I have no job?
10/11/22, 00:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: It was offline
10/11/22, 00:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: Fvck them
10/11/22, 00:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
10/11/22, 00:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No sense of timing 🥲
10/11/22, 00:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How can a group play be successful without discipline in timings
10/11/22, 00:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ask Gowtham on who wrote that 🥲
10/11/22, 00:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: I scolded.
10/11/22, 00:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: What more can I dom
10/11/22, 00:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
10/11/22, 00:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: ?
10/11/22, 00:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nevermind
10/11/22, 00:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Inappropriate humour 🫠
10/11/22, 00:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's frankly insulting
10/11/22, 00:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: Curtain Call has done more than akshar
10/11/22, 00:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: No offense @919499725866
10/11/22, 00:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sorry 🥲
10/11/22, 00:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Me leaving for the moment
10/11/22, 00:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
10/11/22, 00:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: Fvck them
10/11/22, 00:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am in IAR
10/11/22, 00:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: They come to me to do shit
10/11/22, 00:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In my opinion this edition of footprints is a huge downgrade to the previous one
10/11/22, 00:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: I left iar
10/11/22, 00:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You left the IAR group?
10/11/22, 00:33 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yeah
10/11/22, 00:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Or resigned from the team itself? 🥲
10/11/22, 00:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Bro leaving the group won't change things. For a day or two they'll feel they did something to upset you and then they'll forget about it
10/11/22, 00:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Although I don't think staying is going to change things as of now
10/11/22, 00:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't know what to say
10/11/22, 00:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: Nah
10/11/22, 00:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't wanna be part of it
10/11/22, 00:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: So...
10/11/22, 00:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't care if they remember
10/11/22, 00:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1
10/11/22, 00:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: I no longer wanna work for the team.
10/11/22, 00:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 👍
10/11/22, 00:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I hope they do they following editions properly
10/11/22, 00:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I didn't joined IAR this year as it summed up way too much work on just 2-3 guys and i was in both content as well as design team🥲
10/11/22, 00:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was asked to become IAR head, I said no right away
10/11/22, 00:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They gave me lalach of POR which I don't have
10/11/22, 00:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But way too much work 🥲
10/11/22, 00:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And if they have to come to the point of asking me to do something it means quite a lot of people must have rejected the offer before me
10/11/22, 00:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Asking people to become head is not a good sign for an institution (esp a student run one)
10/11/22, 00:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
10/11/22, 00:44 - Amritanshu Raj CR: or maybe they found you competent enough
10/11/22, 00:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It isn't. All our student run clubs have this issue. People aren't coming forward to do things. There is a general lackluster in every community. In CC I've seen Lekshmi do so much work she isn't supposed to be doing. After a point you can't force people to do something.
The purpose of a student club is that it'll run itself, a rolling ball that needs to keep rolling (yes, there is friction, we need it to roll. But it shouldn't stop)
10/11/22, 00:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I dont have POR, not that I don't have lalach for POR
10/11/22, 00:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have no POR. I shouldn't be heading such a huge community with no experience at all
10/11/22, 10:27 - Saamp🐍: ++++++++++++++
10/11/22, 10:27 - Saamp🐍: Say anything I'll never get offended 😌😌
10/11/22, 10:27 - Saamp🐍: I feel bad for you.. 🥲

10/17/22, 22:55 - Saamp🐍: Yes
10/17/22, 23:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: After test2 I'm willing to anything as required 🥲
10/17/22, 23:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *to do...
10/17/22, 23:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But they're coming on 26th
10/17/22, 23:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Let them release the timetable first
10/17/22, 23:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Tutorial after tutorial, test after test, assignment after assignment. There seems to be no end

10/18/22, 22:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: life is a logarithmic spiral 🥲
10/18/22, 22:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: More relaxed and fun than Petrichor or anything else 🙏
10/18/22, 22:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: not me i can confirm 👀, organizing such will lose its charm if they don't incentivise the participants/winners
10/18/22, 22:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
10/18/22, 22:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Petrichor people will be real busy from nov-dec to jan next year from what i have heard
10/18/22, 22:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: You using other's suffering to justify your's, noice
10/18/22, 22:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
10/18/22, 23:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Too much math
10/18/22, 23:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: People who are supposed to be there aren't there 😂
10/18/22, 23:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Petrichor is a lot of work, a lot
10/18/22, 23:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They enjoy it? Some people are really very passionate about it and I greatly admire them
10/20/22, 09:18 - Saamp🐍: Lekshmi didn't say thank u to birthday wishes in ebsb grp
10/20/22, 09:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: EBSB is no longer ours
10/20/22, 09:19 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
10/20/22, 09:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We don't have any clue of what's happening
10/20/22, 09:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They probably have a separate core team apart from us
10/20/22, 09:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also, who is the Akshar head?
10/20/22, 09:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Is it Ayush or Pranav? 🫠
10/20/22, 09:20 - Saamp🐍: Ayush
10/20/22, 09:20 - Saamp🐍: Isn't it?
10/20/22, 09:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I have come to believe that Harsh's core team too was secretly dissolved
10/20/22, 09:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: for oratory and Pranav for writing
10/20/22, 09:20 - Saamp🐍: Ikr
10/20/22, 09:20 - Saamp🐍: Lul
10/20/22, 09:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: most probably
10/20/22, 09:21 - Saamp🐍: Pranav isn't a good organiser
10/20/22, 09:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 09:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 09:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So that means I'm no longer a part of even Akshar, leave the core team 😂
I have it on my CV
10/20/22, 09:22 - Saamp🐍: That's the best thing that can happen

10/20/22, 09:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Model checking class
10/20/22, 09:22 - Saamp🐍: Ooo
10/20/22, 09:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She is probably asleep there 😂
10/20/22, 09:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 09:23 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
10/20/22, 09:23 - Saamp🐍: It is interesting from what I hear
10/20/22, 09:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's unfair in a way. How did they select the new core team, who are these people? Their friends? 🫠
10/20/22, 09:23 - Saamp🐍: Indeed
10/20/22, 09:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ma'am is ruthless
10/20/22, 09:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: when you are so fast that even empathy runs behind you 👀🤣
10/20/22, 09:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She is as close as it gets to someone who would want people to hate them
10/20/22, 09:24 - Saamp🐍: They asked previous core team members if they wanna continue
10/20/22, 09:24 - Saamp🐍: People like akshit refused
10/20/22, 09:25 - Saamp🐍: I'm speed

10/20/22, 09:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>

10/20/22, 09:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: McQueen 😂
10/20/22, 09:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: +1

10/20/22, 09:26 - Saamp🐍: 🔥🔥🔥🔥
10/20/22, 09:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: K probably need another core team POR for my CV next year. EBSB is still there because I write mails. Although I'd prefer some other work too
10/20/22, 09:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My CV is almost empty in the extra curricular section 😶‍🌫️
10/20/22, 09:28 - Saamp🐍: You wanna be a core team member of esports club
10/20/22, 09:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nope
10/20/22, 09:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Some club I like and I know what I'm doing

Fish aren't that easy to catch. Only experienced people will be able to get their hands on a few before the security comes after them 😂
11/4/22, 17:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There are some fish which shouldn't be eaten
Some fish have higher quantities of chemicals in them, so bio magnification in humans

11/5/22, 23:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Today again aloo matar something
11/5/22, 23:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The gravy is very strong for me
11/5/22, 23:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The masala is akin to the masala they use for chicken in some other places 🥲

"Pudina chutney should not have garlic paste"
11/6/22, 13:51 - Saamp🐍: Why not
11/6/22, 13:51 - Saamp🐍: I love garlic 🥲
11/6/22, 13:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
11/6/22, 13:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Pudina chutney bro 🥲
11/6/22, 13:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: Coconut chutney shouldn't have garlic

11/6/22, 14:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Food is deteriorating since freshers came, at least some items
11/6/22, 14:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Aloo masala is even more garlicky and oniony
11/6/22, 14:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What are people like me supposed to eat
11/6/22, 14:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Should have dropped a year and joined a college with a Jain mess
11/6/22, 14:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Or with less preposterous food
11/6/22, 14:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I feel like vomiting at this point
11/6/22, 14:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yesterday I went to food court
11/6/22, 14:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ate mushroom meat masala
11/6/22, 14:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And even with the meat pieces
11/6/22, 14:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm not that experienced, but it was of a meatier taste
11/6/22, 14:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And not the meat I would ever dare to consume
11/6/22, 19:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: https://twitter.com/i/status/1587791635303251970
11/6/22, 20:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
11/6/22, 20:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: You told chicken
11/6/22, 20:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
11/6/22, 20:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There was a second piece after you went 🥲
11/6/22, 20:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: First was chicken for sure
11/6/22, 20:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I didn't say anything as I felt Siddhu might puke then and there 🥲
11/6/22, 20:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
11/6/22, 20:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: I would complain of I got
11/6/22, 20:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This child has put forth very convincing arguments. Even the judicial courts will grant her her rights 🥲
Her father too should agree
11/6/22, 20:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I ain't that sure. Didn't taste a lot like chicken, it was a smaller piece 🥲
11/6/22, 20:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't want to eat of it's that shifty
11/6/22, 20:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: How can they mix up?
11/6/22, 20:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: Like how?
11/6/22, 20:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It happened because I proceeded to eat the remaining gravy with dosa
11/6/22, 20:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They can. For them chicken and beef ain't that different 🥲
11/6/22, 20:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Even finding chicken in mushroom is a very very big deal for me
11/6/22, 20:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents warned me this may happen someday if I eat there 😶‍🌫
11/6/22, 20:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/6/22, 20:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/6/22, 20:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Anyhow can't change what happened
11/6/22, 20:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And today my stomach is totally derailed
11/6/22, 20:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The pudina chutney I got had way too much garlic in it. I didn't even eat it fully, just once
11/6/22, 20:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The taste didn't go away and lunch aloo masala had way too many onions, so did the paneer
11/6/22, 20:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And then I vomited once, still there is a lingering taste of garlic in my mouth
11/6/22, 20:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I brushed my teeth thrice today already
11/6/22, 20:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/6/22, 20:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
11/6/22, 21:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: maybe that is mushroom only, the stem can be a bit more fleshy
11/6/22, 21:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: courts in China? 🥲
judiciary is based on the convinence of communist party and communist party believes in creating robots 👀
11/6/22, 21:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Na bro. I spat it out when I went to wash. It was 100% not mushroom 🥲
11/6/22, 21:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You're very optimistic 🫡
11/6/22, 21:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Non vegetarians can usually distinguish when it's meat and when it isn't 🥲
11/6/22, 21:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And the first piece I got was definitely chicken, it was big too
11/6/22, 21:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Did they shift to creating robots while their one child policy was enforced? 😂
11/6/22, 22:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: sometimes you should accept the truth which reduces guilt, still you can assume even if it was then it was of chicken 🐔 and nothing else 👀
11/6/22, 22:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/6/22, 22:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/6/22, 22:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: be thankful to them for serving chicken in the price of mushrooms 👀
11/6/22, 22:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: they don't individuals with ideas that can challenge the broad assumptive arc of the state, one child though it backfired now still was relatively good for China of 70s which faced grain shortages very often
11/6/22, 22:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not easy my friend 🥲
And what perils my mind is not the fact that I may have mistakenly consumed what I must not consume, but the fact that my guilt shall not let me return to that place again.
11/6/22, 22:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What is worse is that my parents had warned me. They don't really approve of my chicken consumption from mess. But they understand that the sight of the paneer will make me puke.
11/6/22, 22:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I really hope you won't ever land yourself in such a situation, if it already hasn't happened 🐸
11/6/22, 22:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I signed up for mushrooms 🥲
I want to eat healthy stuff in general. Mess is in no way nutritious enough. Everytime I go home I feel so much better. My legs feel better. I feel more energized, I feel happier and stronger in general
11/6/22, 22:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True. But it came at a cost of the victims of the policy, whole families shattered 🥲

11/7/22, 08:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You initially asked him na?
11/7/22, 08:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: Dunno. Ayush wants Vibhum
11/7/22, 08:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Omk
11/7/22, 08:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: And Vibhum is working great.

11/7/22, 08:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I actually ditched a club 😶‍🌫

11/7/22, 08:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: People stepping down from their PORs for various reasons
11/7/22, 08:28 - Lekshmi R Nair: Too long
11/7/22, 08:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: POR nahi chahiye

11/7/22, 08:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>

11/7/22, 08:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I just write mails. I don't get to take part in the planning process
11/7/22, 08:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've to search for some new PORs next year 🥲

11/7/22, 08:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
11/7/22, 08:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Fresher kimds are very excited about everything
11/7/22, 08:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Saw the Yacc bootcamp mail?

11/8/22, 00:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: Movie?
11/8/22, 00:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: I feel this is shitty reasoning.  Don't help people who actually need help, but keep a criteria,  which may not even be a criteria for actual discrimination..
11/8/22, 00:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 4 min video. We aren't good actors. Did so many takes 🥲
11/8/22, 00:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/8/22, 00:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: But still
11/8/22, 00:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: Our video took 5 mins
11/8/22, 00:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interesting. I feel there is a lot of flak on reservation from all sides. 
This in a way is creating a new sort of a divide.
11/8/22, 00:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: Emglish pls
11/8/22, 00:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: From personal experience, I never knew who belonged to which community in school. All of us received the same education and level coaching to an extent.
11/8/22, 00:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is Harsh? 🥲
11/8/22, 00:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Mera dimaag kaam nahi kar raha
11/8/22, 00:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: Nah. Sleepy Lekshmi
11/8/22, 00:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm sitting on the terrace
11/8/22, 00:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: Come beck
11/8/22, 00:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Almost in sleeping posture in front of Sandeep Sir's cabin in front of CCTV
11/8/22, 00:54 - Lekshmi R Nair: .
11/8/22, 00:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
11/8/22, 00:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Me not in terrace. Me near faculty room
11/8/22, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't worry.
11/8/22, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I admit I developed a certain resentment towards the system and even towards them after witnessing them getting into better colleges and kept asking why
11/8/22, 00:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
11/8/22, 00:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
11/8/22, 00:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We were equals before
11/8/22, 00:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
11/8/22, 00:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Now we aren't
11/8/22, 00:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: Gender quota can also create such resentment
11/8/22, 00:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Reservation in a way fostered the inequality as I'll call it
11/8/22, 00:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I strongly agree to that
11/8/22, 00:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: It might not be applicable in ur case since branch change is ur merit
11/8/22, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I got in because of those extra seats, which I'm extremely grateful fot
11/8/22, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I know there is resentment
11/8/22, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have experienced it and acknowledge it
11/8/22, 00:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sometimes this may belittle your actual achievements, in case of social and gender reservations
11/8/22, 00:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I just try to ensure that I don't waste what the system has given me
11/8/22, 01:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interesting. As long as students are free to not attend it should be alright
11/8/22, 01:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I want to eat something nice
11/8/22, 01:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Tbh I'm fat. Even with the stuffed towels I don't look pregnant 🥲
11/8/22, 01:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You're CC head for a reason. You give direction. Here everything is going according to my vision 🫠

11/8/22, 01:10 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am scared of malayali communists
11/8/22, 01:10 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
11/8/22, 01:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: The biggest issue with communists is that they never get full credit for their contributions to humankind, like they did help mange earth's population Stalin dispatched millions to heaven with his policies and Mao too promoted sustainability by reducing atleast 6 million greedy humans through his great policies
11/8/22, 01:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why demlete? Me was trying to comprehend 🫠

In the email thread titled,

Fwd: Online Interaction with Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar ji for first year students on 11/11/2022 at 6.30 PM

Sent at 19:37, 3 Nov 2022 by the Dean (Student affairs), the first year students are directed to attend the online interaction with Mr. Ravi Shankar organised by NIT Uttarakhand. The invitation letter also claims “Gurudev is guiding students on the beginning of their new professional journey.”

Mr. Ravi Shankar is a person who has made several derogatory remarks about public institutions in the past such as “Govt. schools and colleges are breeding grounds of naxalites”, “There should be a religious committee in the country which checks upon the functioning of every educational institutions”, etc. His views on topics like gender, sexuality, and mental health are highly regressive and unscientific. Forwarding this invitation in the official email ID of Dean students would indicate that the institute is endorsing the same

As our institute proudly upholds the idea of ‘nurturing minds for a better world’ and ‘improving the scientific temper of the people’, any form of association with the talk by such a person is unjust to our objectives.

We the undersigned feels that the scientific temper and past remarks of speakers must be subjected to proper scrutiny before forwarding such email invitations to the talks and also urge the institute administration to disassociate with this and any such activities in the future.

So they can't play baseball? 🫠
11/8/22, 14:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Dear Neeraj, and others,

For your information, the mail regarding the event was from one of the NITs (one of the national institutions) and the information was just forwarded to the student community if any one is interested to attend or listen. It is common practice among the national institutions to disseminate any events they are organizing. There was no compulsion to attend and if anyone attends it there is nothing wrong in it.

Better you read the forwarded message from me. You don't DICTATE what others want to listen or attend if they are within the law and regulations of the institute.

Also, you have wrongly quoted my mail: "the first year students are directed to attend the online interaction with Mr. Ravi Shankar organised by NIT Uttarakhand".  Did I direct anyone? Why don't the institute authority take action against you people for spreading false information? .

Thank you,
Jagadeesh
11/8/22, 14:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Are there no African American baseball players? 🥲

11/8/22, 19:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Dear Prof Bayry, 

While you are holding a position like Students affairs Dean, how can you 'just forward' mails to the entire student community and not take responsibility for its content? Even if you are not compelling anyone, in effect you are suggesting it by virtue of forwarding it from the official id. And the students have the right question it. Instead of addressing their questions democratically and engage in discussions, you are trying to threaten them with actions by institute authorities. Students deserves better response from their Dean. 

I stand in solidarity with the students who highlighted the issue. 

Best, 
Krishnapriya KC

11/8/22, 20:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Dear Krishnapriya mam,
I literally feel that I do not have the right to say something in this issue but your discussion feels like creating an issue which is not. Thus, thinking of reactions on mentality on mind of me and my fellow friends, I just humbly want to tell you that
NIT Uttarakhand is a government institution, What they are organizing is supposed to be fare for the students and thus dissemination of a national Institution program for the welfare of the students should be seen as a great job.
There are people in Academic section of NIT Uttarakhand who are more scientific than we students, so if the talk was anyway going to be unscientific or will going to harm the students they must not have organised it.
Rest even now you and others do have a problem then there are many others who feels such talks to be motivating and relaxing. 
Note: I Don't want to exaggerate this issue or don't want to misbehave with you and rest.
Thus please forgive me for any such my words which hurt you.
Thanks & Sorry for any which which feels like misbehaving
Govind Kumar

11/8/22, 20:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: Thank you for sending entertaining mail in this group
11/8/22, 20:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂😂😂
11/8/22, 20:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: didn't want to get indulged in the conversation, but now I think I should! 

Dear Neeraj, may I know the basis of you saying that "His views on topics like gender, sexuality, and mental health are highly regressive and unscientific!!"?? A research scholar stating facts without actually checking the facts/reading already published research papers is usually unexpected! So, let me tell you a few studies on The Art of Living organization and the techniques taught by them! There was a study by YALE in which they showed how the SKY technique scientifically helped in reducing stress, anxiety & depression! A Study by AIIMS showed how SKY technique helped in curing Cancer patients. So much more research has already been done on how the techniques taught by them have helped 500+millions lives across 180 countries!  These programs are conducted for Scientists in NASA, are conducted regularly in IISC, many NITs, IITs, several institutes of Kota, Delhi & Chandigarh! 
You can find relatable links to verify this information on Google, Youtube, etc. (Google Scholar as well!)

I hope I addressed the concerns dear Krishnapriya! 

Last but not the least, as Prof Baryr said, students are not entitled to join the talk! It's their will if they want to join or not (being in a democratic society, let the students decide whether they want to join it or not!). The mail regarding the event was from one of the NITs (one of the national institutions), so I can bet they already verified the details before forwarding to all the National institutions! And just FYI, NIT students are already benefiting from these techniques :) 

In case you want any more details about the organisation or the founder himself, feel free to contact me (personally, not in this thread!). 

Warm Regards
Komal Aggarwal :)

11/8/22, 20:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Dear all,
I guess the discussions are going in the wrong direction. If the mail was forwarded from a student group or a staff member as passing an information it would be fine. Also if some student club had invited him over for a talk that is also acceptable. But since the mail was forwarded from an official email handle the question is whether the institute is officially associated with the session or not. If yes then the protest stays valid. If not, then it should not have been forwarded as recieved from an official account. I think the matter is now being handled immaturely and out of rage.

11/8/22, 23:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Dear all,
I request all of you to read THIS article by Prof. Sundar Sarukkai on 'The nature of dissent'.  I am also attaching a pdf version along with this email. 

Coming to the topic of the petition, our constitution says that it is our duty to  "develop scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform".  The current draft of IIT Palakkad's vision document espouses "boundaryless inquiries and interactions, and free and independent thinking".   Aren't the petitioners trying to uphold the spirit of our constitution and the vision of our institute?
Free and open exchange of ideas and disagreements are fundamental to the generation and propagation of knowledge. Let us engage in this discussion with a spirit of enquiry and camaraderie.

Best regards,
Sarath

11/12/22, 17:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Dearest Neeraj, Lijo M Jose, Athul Krishnan PV, Aiswarya Pradeepkumar, Kavya PG and Nayana EC,
I am very happy to see the sense of responsibility you people feel towards upholding our institute’s motto: “nurturing minds for a better world”. Because a students’ role in the shaping of an institute’s academic and other cultures is very indispensable. But, often unfortunately, we do not see them realise this vital role of theirs, of course, due to varied reasons. I’m very happy to see that you people have realised it.

But I’m not sure how good a mode is the one you have opted for – to gather solidarity via a signed petition. Because tomorrow if the HSS department or some other platforms of the institute wants to invite someone whom a bunch of students/faculty in the institute feel is either an “anti-national” or “unscientific fellow” and if they come up with a signed petition, should we refrain from inviting that person? NO, right? Certainly we would not!

So, if we KNOW that Mr. Ravi Shankar is "regressive" and "unscientific", I think we should make sure to attend and ACTIVELY participate in the event, so that he also knows it.

Remember: Strong people DISSENT, stronger ones ENGAGE ACTIVELY.

And do you people know what the strongest (who is also the wisest) do? No? Come and meet me! ;-)

And I do not agree that Prof. Bairy endorses the speaker just because he forwarded the event invite. As Dean students he just would have forwarded an event that is taking place in another educational institution. All of us do that. And with many exciting events happening in many other educational institutions (especially when we have an online access available to it) definitely we should continue to do so. And I’m also sure our Dean Students did not actually mean any disciplinary action against young bright minds like you, though he responded so at that moment. He for sure knows that these are very very ordinary happenings in an educational institution through which both the institute and the students grow.

And thank you so much Sarath for Prof. Sundar Sarukkai's article (which I'm attaching with the mail for the students to read)!

@ students - Hey all it is a very short but nice piece. Do read! Don't give yourself excuses like "we had a lot of deadlines to meet" as you people usually do in our CGP and MIS class!!

Have a good weekend everyone!

Love,

Sujatha.

11/12/22, 17:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Adding to Sujatha's excellent point on actively engaging rather than "cancelling", I urge everyone to watch videos of pseudoscientific people like Ben Shapiro or Jaggi Vasudev "owning" college students in verbal confrontations. Rhetoric is becoming a lost art. Cancelling pseudoscientific people makes them martyrs in the eyes of their followers.  It is far better to murder them with well-reasoned arguments.

11/13/22, 17:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I realised that sambar rice is tasty. I like it. But I can't eat just sambar and rice and potatoes daily 🥲
11/13/22, 17:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: it contains way too much oil 🥲
11/13/22, 17:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents have stopped telling me about what they eat daily because I can't handle it anymore
11/13/22, 17:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I say squeeze it 😂
11/13/22, 17:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 'claim' is the key here
11/13/22, 17:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They are paid to feed us
11/13/22, 17:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Can't we drag them to court? 🥲
11/13/22, 17:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: come Nila buy from swiggy broad menu fast delivery
11/13/22, 17:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I feel increasingly weak these days. Can't stay up for as long as I'm used to. Stomach upsets more often. Lethargic in general even after eating all meals 🥲
11/13/22, 17:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: buy pickles, also buy probiotic curb from home centre
11/13/22, 17:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I feel I've some deficiency at the point
11/13/22, 17:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: *curd
11/13/22, 17:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: banana cake then 🥲
11/13/22, 17:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have pickles, but how much nutrition does it add? 
Also I don't like curd 😶‍🌫
11/13/22, 17:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Money
11/13/22, 17:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's not bad 🥲
11/13/22, 17:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: college is also paid to teach us, did you ever questioned them 👀😂
11/13/22, 17:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: new institute 🥲
11/13/22, 17:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I feel dizzy sometimes. I joke around that I'm dizzy but I actually am. I tried sleeping for 6 hours per day for the past one week. That hasn't improved anything 🫠
11/13/22, 17:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, call parents with resupply buy more fruits, drink more water
11/13/22, 17:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They can destroy my life and career 😶‍🌫
11/13/22, 17:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/13/22, 17:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: no nutrition just will diversify the menu and help the taste
11/13/22, 17:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have fruits. I called parents, I am drinking way more water than usual. Unusual levels of thirst. Often I have to refill my bottle after every class
11/13/22, 17:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: curd is a good thing i must say, add salt or sugar make compromises
11/13/22, 17:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can still eat this stuff, I needn't make it tastier, I need to make it healthier
11/13/22, 17:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/13/22, 17:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: no money is of use if you can't even live happily
11/13/22, 17:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I vomit 😂
Curd isn't my thing 
When my mother was pregnant with me she supposedly ate one pot of mishti doi per day. I've had enough curd to last me a lifetime
11/13/22, 17:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/13/22, 17:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True, I can shift to Malabar and maybe I should whenever it's possible 🫠
11/13/22, 17:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Malabar is affordable
11/13/22, 17:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but atleast that won't degrade your health, visit doctor call parents buy suppliments
11/13/22, 17:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: aren't they already 😶‍🌫

11/13/22, 17:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: After one whole year my body is unable to take it anymore
11/13/22, 17:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: buy dry fruits, maybe fig, date etc
11/13/22, 17:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Fig is a good idea. I'll buy those
11/13/22, 17:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, try multivitamins then
11/13/22, 17:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Maggie nono. I don't eat it from the mess, ever.
Horlicks let me consider
11/13/22, 17:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oo, i see
11/13/22, 17:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but do they serve nutritious food
11/13/22, 17:24 - Saamp🐍: <Media omitted>
11/13/22, 17:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They have curry with things other than onion and potatoes 😂

11/13/22, 17:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Thanks 🥺
11/13/22, 17:25 - Saamp🐍: ++
11/13/22, 17:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 3 hours. But it is tiring. Parents won't let me come
11/13/22, 17:26 - Saamp🐍: Y not
11/13/22, 17:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I need food. Otherwise I think I'm fine 😂
11/13/22, 17:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, thank me later for helping you survive here 😎🤣
11/13/22, 17:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: One day isn't worth it according to them. I tried to return in that October recess after my friends bailed out on our idea of going on a trip. But they told me not to come
11/13/22, 17:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And father will come next week I believe. He said he'll come
11/13/22, 17:28 - Saamp🐍: Sreeram goes always 😌
11/13/22, 17:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because just 2 days
11/13/22, 17:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I know. My house is 30km away fr his
11/13/22, 17:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Thanks 😂
11/13/22, 17:28 - Saamp🐍: Ask someone who can not go home for 4 months
11/13/22, 17:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: compare what is more tiring a 3x2 hr journey or 10 times of onion infested food, then call the shot
11/13/22, 17:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
11/13/22, 17:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I bow down to you folks

11/13/22, 17:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I like how you used the word 'infested' 😂
11/13/22, 17:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: BTW @919188011081 that new bioscope guy is a Bengali
11/13/22, 17:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: try to work out some arrangement with people who go that way, you all leave together (safety issues addressed)
11/13/22, 17:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you asking me something 🥲

11/13/22, 17:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i am alive and kicking though lost a bit weight this stay (not necessarily a bad thing)
11/13/22, 17:31 - Lekshmi R Nair: He is from calcutta
11/13/22, 17:31 - Saamp🐍: Talking about me too 😂
11/13/22, 17:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ahh, safety is no issue. I'm fairly comfortable along this route. But transport is. I'll be stranded if I leave on Friday after classes. Train is at 4. I can't miss OS lab. If I take bus I'll be stranded 20km away fr home with no other transport
11/13/22, 17:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i absorb limterature through my skin 😎🤣
11/13/22, 17:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That day I got a doubt after looking at him. He doesn't have that accent. But his name confirmed it
11/13/22, 17:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: What's his name
11/13/22, 17:32 - Saamp🐍: You can miss it just tell ta to take your viva early and boom

11/13/22, 17:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You all want anything? I can ask my father to bring
11/13/22, 17:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He won't say no
11/13/22, 17:33 - Saamp🐍: Thanks for asking 😌
11/13/22, 17:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Anyhow my friends here don't eat anything of what they bring 😂
11/13/22, 17:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: call father there, maybe car or bike if he knows, else hire an auto
11/13/22, 17:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Souvik Mallick
11/13/22, 17:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Bus at 2 bro 😂
11/13/22, 17:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Omk 😌
11/13/22, 17:34 - Saamp🐍: Go to hell then
11/13/22, 17:34 - Saamp🐍: 🙄
11/13/22, 17:34 - Saamp🐍: Ab dono haatho me ladoo kaise hoge
11/13/22, 17:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That would be a bit too much 🥲
11/13/22, 17:34 - Saamp🐍: @919205513216 translate the pharse
11/13/22, 17:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Literal meaning understood not the intended one 😂
11/13/22, 17:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you can't have best of both worlds
11/13/22, 17:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's not so easy 🫡
11/13/22, 17:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Omk
11/13/22, 17:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Makes sense
11/13/22, 17:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Anyhow I'm going for snacks now 😂
11/13/22, 17:35 - Saamp🐍: Why aren't you in linguistics

11/13/22, 17:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You go for snacks almost everyday 😶‍🌫
11/13/22, 17:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: nope, i loved no attendance policy, ma'am killed my love and i witness it every time i attend the class
11/13/22, 17:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Nila people convinced me somehow life will easy in the other room 🥲😂
11/13/22, 17:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/13/22, 17:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: with this statement, i felt it 3 inches below my heart from the backside 🥲🤣🤣🤣
11/13/22, 17:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents are not really very satisfied with my grades. Coming home will waste time according to them, mostly father. And last day after seeing my new cgpa all he asked about was the D in probability and not the new courses that were added 🥲
They have high expectations from me. They want me to do as well as I did in school, better than everyone else. That I can't. I have a life too. I'm not at home. And I am unable to make him realise that 🫠
That's why going home or even meeting them at this point will likely upset me more. Food is better for sure, but I don't want my mental health to go downhill now 😂
11/13/22, 17:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂😂😂
11/13/22, 17:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Linguistics is nice if you're in the right group. Isn't it @919499725866? 😂
11/13/22, 17:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So close. Missed it narrowly. Next time it'll be a hit I promise 😂

11/13/22, 17:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Recently found this. I really like it. Few lines are in Bangla
11/13/22, 17:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not over yet 😂
11/13/22, 17:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Postpone postpone and postponeed

11/13/22, 17:44 - Amritanshu Raj CR: You Lekshmi?👀😂
11/13/22, 17:44 - Saamp🐍: +1
11/13/22, 17:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: See @919205513216

11/13/22, 17:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Noiceeee ❤️
11/13/22, 17:45 - Saamp🐍: You should
11/13/22, 17:45 - Saamp🐍: We don't mind
11/13/22, 17:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Me her friend. My roommate in same group
11/13/22, 17:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, take janta in your trust by assuring em what you doing is what toppers do?
make em feel absolute maximum is an unhealthy obsession here and should be traded off with other perks
11/13/22, 17:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: my naiveness points that there is some dark humour going on 👀🤣
11/13/22, 17:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: dark humour= very light healthy cold war
11/13/22, 17:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: someone call police and an ambulance too but not for me 👀😂
11/13/22, 17:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/13/22, 17:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: both of you
11/13/22, 17:52 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oo, i see, Let Lekshmi be aware that you stealing her identity and becoming increasingly intrusive in her independence
11/13/22, 18:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not doing the work is not acceptable. You have no idea how much stress it caused me that day 🥲
I expect more from all of you
11/13/22, 18:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Parents are parents 🫡
I can try, I have tried before. But not working
11/13/22, 18:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There is. You're not naïve. You know exactly what's going on 🫡
11/13/22, 18:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/13/22, 18:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't intend to indulge in any form of identity theft 🥲
11/13/22, 18:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And with that I won't want to work with all of you in anything again
11/13/22, 18:26 - Saamp🐍: Noted

11/13/22, 21:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i see linguistic influence here ï must say
11/13/22, 21:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: toxicity

11/13/22, 22:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's just a harmless carton of milk. I drank milk from the mess today after a long time
11/13/22, 22:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sorry @919188011081 🥲
11/13/22, 22:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
11/13/22, 22:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm sorry 🥲
11/13/22, 22:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: Eh
11/13/22, 22:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I indulged in identity theft 😶‍🌫
11/13/22, 22:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents called just now to let me know that end sems are approaching and they hope I'm studying 😂
11/13/22, 22:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can't reason with them at present. Maybe an in person heated conversation will have better results
11/13/22, 23:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: really you are the one who drew my attention that this milk package had a middle finger trick. You saw it that way: As Anaïs Nin put it, “We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are.” 
noice, get tiny packets of horlicks add it in the milk, boost is also good
11/13/22, 23:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: is it an warning call like thing?
11/13/22, 23:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: heated conversation may escalate sporadically, better sit and discuss more peacefully
11/14/22, 13:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ï agree with you. Since joining college I've become more observant to hidden meaning in everything (be it sexual innuendos or other intricacies of conversation) 😂

Omk 🫡
11/14/22, 13:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I think yes. Also father will come to visit me next week 😂🫠
11/14/22, 13:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I meant that no matter how I try to bring this up, it'll eventually become a heated discussion. I can never win in an argument with my parents. They have the advantage with better Bangla. My arguments don't seem convincing enough unless I shift to English
11/14/22, 13:52 - Lekshmi R Nair: @919499725866 ice-cream

Makes me feel old now. I remember how my last children's day went
11/14/22, 19:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They give jalebis to everyone on that day. I ate my jalebi in class. Later I went to the staff room for some work and also got jalebis from the teachers 😂

11/16/22, 12:53 - Amritanshu Raj CR: is this sticker based on Geroge orwell's Animal farm?
11/16/22, 12:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nope. Need money for consultation
11/16/22, 12:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm broke
11/16/22, 12:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's among my favorite books. This is a good representation, but add a few pigs in robes drinking wine
11/16/22, 19:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, then nothing can be done, accept for your fate comrade 👀🤣
11/16/22, 19:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Says who, one who sends a lakh to others in way similar to Russian rollet
11/16/22, 19:07 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Yep, it is gem of literature. I agree with you *sticker* 🤣
11/16/22, 19:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes, comrade 👀
11/16/22, 19:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Today in ethics one of the presentation topic was "should euthanasia be legalized"
11/16/22, 19:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interesting topic. I would like a longer discussion on it someday. I wanted to hear what others have to say
11/16/22, 19:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *roulette
11/16/22, 19:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's my parents' money. They fund my foolishness 🥲
11/16/22, 19:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I feel dumb as I say this 🥲
It's among the most foolish things I've ever done
11/16/22, 19:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
11/16/22, 19:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I like 1984 too
11/16/22, 19:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: George Orwell is a gem of a writer
11/16/22, 19:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Nope, never, because irrespective of the condition of an individual we can't deny him/her right to live. Life is more than just comfort. Even in suffering there is meaning.
11/16/22, 19:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/16/22, 19:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Article 21 extends right to life in the indian constitution and also the DPSP promotes socialism where universal basic healthcare is the responsibility of the state then no need to kill someone just because he is unable to make a decision for his life because now health and life is more than just individual
11/16/22, 19:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Then they can fund your trip to cardiologist 👀
11/16/22, 19:44 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/16/22, 19:45 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/16/22, 19:46 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Added to the list will read it sometime in near future
11/16/22, 20:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What if the person has a living will?
11/16/22, 20:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Even if not, what is perpetual suffering worth it?
11/16/22, 20:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ~what~
11/16/22, 20:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There is no way to know if the living will was made in pressure
11/16/22, 20:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: If you make active euthanasia a right, it soon becomes a duty. The patient, knowing that he or she can die by choice, will soon feel it incumbent to relieve relatives of the 'burden' of looking after them. When that stage is reached you have removed the patient's choice
11/16/22, 20:57 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Will or no will is of ni difference, it will soon become psychologically forced euthensia
11/16/22, 21:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Promoting euthanasia is like walking on a downhill slope once the society started, people will start making suicidal decisions in the veil of euthanasia and there will be no way to separate them out especially in a morally corrupt society like ours. Also euthanasia for mental suffering will be one of the demands
11/16/22, 21:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: Shit
11/16/22, 21:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: That's deep
11/16/22, 21:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes, I'm still reading and thinking 🫡
11/16/22, 21:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I didn't think much about euthanasia until today
11/16/22, 22:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Agreed. But healthcare is practically not guaranteed to everyone. Someone who can't afford pain meds for themselves and they are terminally ill and in great pain. Suppose it's a rare ailment whose treatment/meds are rare and expensive and the individual is in constant excruciating pain
11/16/22, 22:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What about a high dose radiation survivor. Ultimately doomed for death within one week or two at most. Going through unfathomable doom and nothing can be done. This person's body is fighting against all odds trying to keep itself alive
11/16/22, 22:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My mother always accompanies me to the doctor. She is hyper. Does all the talking herself. I never get an opportunity to speak. The doc usually diagnoses her perception of my ailment 😂
11/16/22, 22:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: Does yukta ji hate me?
11/16/22, 22:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
11/16/22, 22:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nice. I have the hard copy somewhere at home
11/16/22, 22:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why 😂
11/16/22, 22:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What did you ask?
11/16/22, 22:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: IR?
11/16/22, 22:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She doesn't know much. I can explain what I did
11/16/22, 22:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: I think trip?
11/16/22, 22:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: Pls do
11/16/22, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents won't let me go if there is no functional malayali in the group
11/16/22, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't think so, I could sense tensions between you from long back
11/16/22, 22:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: Eh
11/16/22, 22:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: I didn't?
11/16/22, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also even though they are saying no, their parents certainly think I'm some sort of a functional malayali
11/16/22, 22:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: I was a functional malayali
11/16/22, 22:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ur parents said no
11/16/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Even for them, I can't carry the responsibility of a group
11/16/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I like to be carefree
11/16/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm responsible only for myself
11/16/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Can't look after so many people 🥲
11/16/22, 22:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: I Don particularly wanna go to tvm
11/16/22, 22:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: It doesn't feel like a trip
11/16/22, 22:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There is this implicit responsibility that will fall on me
11/16/22, 22:25 - Lekshmi R Nair: I will be the responsible one then???
11/16/22, 22:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I will be obliged to not enter the temple at that time of the month. Nikhitha really wants to go to temple. I suggested Kochi. I'll gladly come and can take them around like a local. My father can join us and it would be nice
11/16/22, 22:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You are 😂
You just don't know it 🥲
11/16/22, 22:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't intend to frighten you
11/16/22, 22:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents don't think of you to be responsible for me
11/16/22, 22:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They just don't want me to be responsible for the rest of the group
11/16/22, 22:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They know I can survive alone here. It's Kerala. I live here. I've gone to Tvm multiple times before
11/16/22, 22:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's alright. You shouldn't be pressurized to decide 🥲
11/16/22, 22:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They said no after your being there became uncertain
11/16/22, 22:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Father offered to come to Tvm. But that will ruin the fun for me. I can't leave him alone and spend time with friends. I will feel guilty 🥲
11/16/22, 22:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Although he was reluctant later after thinking that now he will be responsible for the group. So he said no
11/16/22, 22:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He can only take my responsibility and nobody else's
11/16/22, 22:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't want my dad there either
11/16/22, 22:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: He will offer to come
11/16/22, 22:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I understand his concerns. I understand that doesn't particularly not want me to go and enjoy. He is worried that I'll become a sort of a caretaker and a medium of communication (that's not bad per say), but I can't be thrust with the duty of bringing the group back safely
11/16/22, 22:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: I can't be free
11/16/22, 22:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ++
11/16/22, 22:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't know
11/16/22, 22:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yukta seems angry
11/16/22, 22:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: Kavya backed out
11/16/22, 22:32 - Lekshmi R Nair: I will be pissed too
11/16/22, 22:33 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't wanna particularly go to hampi either
11/16/22, 22:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: People will go in different directions. On our Palakkad trip they were here and there, some on the ropeway and some not. It'll become chaotic. I'm not a tour guide. But there is this duty that goes unsaid 🥲
11/16/22, 22:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why though. It'll be a nice experience
11/16/22, 22:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Her mother was very concerned 🥲
11/16/22, 22:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nothing can be done 🥲
Everyone wants different things. One tour, one temple, one Jatayu etc... 🥲
11/16/22, 22:34 - Lekshmi R Nair: I had to direct people
11/16/22, 22:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
11/16/22, 22:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's time we have to move
11/16/22, 22:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yada yada
11/16/22, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I feel Kochi is a good option
11/16/22, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Exactly
11/16/22, 22:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: ++
11/16/22, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I feel at peace with the place
11/16/22, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But Yukta wants to go somewhere far
11/16/22, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nikhitha really wants to go to Padmanabhaswamy
11/16/22, 22:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That'll happen to me now. Tvm is a more alien sort of place to me. I can't take that responsibility 🥲
11/16/22, 22:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How will the trip be fun for me if I have to essentially look after people 🥲
11/16/22, 22:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If this wasn't the case my parents would gladly let me go. It's not about a functional malayali. It's about shifting this burden on someone else  😂
11/16/22, 22:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There are nice places to visit. Historical places. They don't seem interested. But I can forever gaze into the sea from the shores of the beach. Going into old buildings, churches etc is something I like
11/16/22, 22:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Walking through busy markets, watching people and everything I've known for a long time. Although others won't be interested in this part 😶‍🌫
11/16/22, 22:40 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ooo
11/16/22, 22:40 - Lekshmi R Nair: Elaborate pls
11/16/22, 22:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Never mind, it is the trip only
11/16/22, 22:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I thought I sensed something back then
11/16/22, 22:41 - Lekshmi R Nair: 👀👀👀
11/16/22, 22:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You both don't talk as much
11/16/22, 22:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 👀👀👀
11/16/22, 22:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: As before
11/16/22, 22:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can take them to Chottanikkara temple if they really want to visit a famous temple 😂
11/16/22, 22:42 - Lekshmi R Nair: True
11/16/22, 22:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And there is Vypin
11/16/22, 22:43 - Lekshmi R Nair: When in room she doesn't talk to me, and I spend considerable time outside room
11/16/22, 22:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The ferry
11/16/22, 22:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Marine drive
11/16/22, 22:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm all ready for Kochi
11/16/22, 22:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What about out
R wonderla trip?

11/16/22, 22:45 - Saamp🐍: Go to home people
11/16/22, 22:45 - Saamp🐍: Don't waste money

11/16/22, 23:26 - Saamp🐍: Ask her why you guys don't talk much
Did I do something wrong 
Is there anything that's bothering you you can tell me you know


Just be transparent about your feelings
11/16/22, 23:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: (Walls have ears)
11/16/22, 23:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: This is what mess is already doing, why should I waste my time on it
11/16/22, 23:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
I abandoned all curries. Me surviving on daal and rice now 🥲
11/16/22, 23:27 - Saamp🐍: Not to offend you but maybe not being in room as much as before can be one reason as you may not be there when she needs you and she had to go to someone else....
11/16/22, 23:27 - Saamp🐍: Coming on the trip part
11/16/22, 23:27 - Saamp🐍: Trips happen like this only a lot of confusion miscommunication
11/16/22, 23:28 - Saamp🐍: But at the end place doesn't matter it's the memories that you make
11/16/22, 23:28 - Saamp🐍: You make sure you guys go together and have fun
11/16/22, 23:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Talking is the best way. Bit slowly. She won't open up all at once
11/16/22, 23:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Still, calling an innocent individual a grill 👀
11/16/22, 23:28 - Saamp🐍: I personally hate seeing friends go apart so talk it out.....
11/16/22, 23:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's a metaphor
11/16/22, 23:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I feel Yukta is very particular about trips
11/16/22, 23:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She is forever lamenting on the fact that she doesn't have good pics from OBT
11/16/22, 23:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲
11/16/22, 23:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: On a slightly unrelated note
11/16/22, 23:30 - Saamp🐍: I don't think that's the only thing there maybe some unresolved conflict that's bothering her and that ended up ruining this too dunno
11/16/22, 23:30 - Saamp🐍: Personally I don't care about people

11/19/22, 23:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He can now effortlessly consume raw onions
11/19/22, 23:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because it's not something we eat 🥲

11/20/22, 09:50 - Saamp🐍: You're a bad good person 😂
11/20/22, 09:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Deciding clues, places, hiding
11/20/22, 09:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Too late bro 🥲
11/20/22, 09:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You can watch the freshers running around though 😂
11/20/22, 09:51 - Saamp🐍: Ikr but I think it's better to regret later then roam in sunlight and curse life
11/20/22, 09:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
11/20/22, 09:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Take umbrella
11/20/22, 09:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There is a certain person here who went to all surveying lab sessions with an umbrella 😂
11/20/22, 09:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Last time we started at 5:30 or something
11/20/22, 09:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: To hide clues 🥲
11/20/22, 09:53 - Saamp🐍: Fffffffff
11/20/22, 09:53 - Saamp🐍: But I heard it's a lot of fun
11/20/22, 09:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I had to hide stuff in windmill, mess, cricket pitch, basketball court, ahalai engg college
11/20/22, 09:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It is
11/20/22, 09:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But tiring too 😂
11/20/22, 09:53 - Saamp🐍: Me mota insaan 🥲
11/20/22, 09:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I didn't have cycle. Those with cycle went to far away places like food court, rock garden
11/20/22, 09:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why do you think so? 😂
11/20/22, 09:54 - Saamp🐍: Poor freshers
11/20/22, 09:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You're not mota

11/20/22, 09:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Is there any other meaning to mota insaan other than fat person? 😂
11/20/22, 09:55 - Saamp🐍: One name isn't sufficient
11/20/22, 09:55 - Saamp🐍: Bada insaan
11/20/22, 09:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was fun to make them run around 😌
11/20/22, 09:55 - Saamp🐍: If mota int. gujarati
11/20/22, 09:55 - Saamp🐍: In
11/20/22, 09:55 - Saamp🐍: Interpreted

11/20/22, 09:55 - Saamp🐍: Orrr
11/20/22, 09:55 - Saamp🐍: Kind of
11/20/22, 09:55 - Saamp🐍: Anyone you respect
11/20/22, 09:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You have a big heart, metaphorically, not in reality 😂
11/20/22, 09:55 - Saamp🐍: Or your senior
11/20/22, 09:55 - Saamp🐍: Elder
11/20/22, 09:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Everyone respects you then 😌
11/20/22, 09:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 09:56 - Saamp🐍: <Media omitted>

11/20/22, 09:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Can you hula hoop? 😂
11/20/22, 09:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's a friend of his 👀
11/20/22, 09:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also you know what
11/20/22, 09:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Haripriya saved my number
11/20/22, 09:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: After two years of knowing each other 😂
11/20/22, 09:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Direction of entropy will change now
11/20/22, 09:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The universe is headed towards doom
11/20/22, 09:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And destruction
11/20/22, 09:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Gib party but not ice cream
11/20/22, 09:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What do you want? Oranges?
11/20/22, 10:00 - Saamp🐍: That's from the starting of kalyug right what's new in this?
11/20/22, 10:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Food court treat?
11/20/22, 10:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Indeed, kalyug has accelerated
11/20/22, 10:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Paracetamol and maybe antibiotic would be highly appreciated for now
11/20/22, 10:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I heartily agree 😌
11/20/22, 10:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Demm 👀
11/20/22, 10:01 - Saamp🐍: If you see this is a linguistic question
11/20/22, 10:01 - Saamp🐍: Structural ambiguity
11/20/22, 10:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Many people are returning to Nila by 5:30 bus I guess
11/20/22, 10:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If that bus is still there
11/20/22, 10:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If you can find anyone to deliver it to your doorstep
11/20/22, 10:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'll gladly give you all the meds you need
11/20/22, 10:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's more like absence of comma causes issues 😂
11/20/22, 10:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Good for them
11/20/22, 10:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Antibiotic for cold, why? 🥲
11/20/22, 10:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've seen Yukta take lots of antibiotics for fever and I go why again and again 🥲
11/20/22, 10:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Could be good for you as well
11/20/22, 10:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Probably not gonna need it for now, hopefully things won't escalate else people here too have some meds
11/20/22, 10:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Tonsill and sore throat 🥲
11/20/22, 10:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Gargle with salt
11/20/22, 10:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Rise of super bugs 👀
11/20/22, 10:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Omk
11/20/22, 10:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I will
11/20/22, 10:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's the best way I believe 🥲
Nothing better than gargling. At home I gargle twice a week irrespective of if I'm having a cold or not. It helps keep my tonsils in check
11/20/22, 10:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Yep, it is very effective
11/20/22, 10:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 10:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Do you have kettle?
11/20/22, 10:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: For hot water?
11/20/22, 10:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The water dispensers usually don't have water that hot
11/20/22, 10:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also @919188011081 don't take the indi home thing to heart. There is one more round 😌
11/20/22, 10:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Such things happen
11/20/22, 10:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also, which chocolate do you want?
11/20/22, 10:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: All of you...
11/20/22, 10:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Nope
11/20/22, 10:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't wabt
11/20/22, 10:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Will get it from filter
11/20/22, 10:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've kept one aside for you 🥲
11/20/22, 10:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not hot enough 😂😶‍🌫
11/20/22, 10:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't feel bad about what I said yesterday
11/20/22, 10:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I didn't intend to hurt you 🥲
11/20/22, 10:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The message didn't go across in one piece
11/20/22, 10:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: For Drinking purpose it's sufficient, for gargle I will mix super hot water of gyser in normal water
11/20/22, 10:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Good idea 🙏
11/20/22, 10:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 10:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Just like one more my idea 👀😂

11/20/22, 10:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Update: One kitkat and two dairy milks out of stock
11/20/22, 12:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 12:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: @919499725866 you know what happened
11/20/22, 12:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Treasure hunt ended
11/20/22, 12:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The team didn't even reach my room
11/20/22, 12:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The fastest team already won 🥲
11/20/22, 12:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
11/20/22, 12:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was waiting for them
11/20/22, 12:31 - Saamp🐍: Lul
11/20/22, 12:31 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ehhhh
11/20/22, 12:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Annoyed my roommate at 6AM by cleaning my room
11/20/22, 12:31 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂
11/20/22, 12:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: One team was warly
11/20/22, 12:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Heck, even Yukta cleaned her room
11/20/22, 12:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 12:32 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
11/20/22, 12:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 12:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Brain drain
11/20/22, 12:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I asked organisers to let them complete the hunt if time permits 🫠
11/20/22, 12:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: One team came to your room @919188011081 😂
11/20/22, 12:45 - Lekshmi R Nair: Kyu
11/20/22, 12:45 - Lekshmi R Nair: What was the prompt btw
11/20/22, 12:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No clue
11/20/22, 12:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Just contacts and your names
11/20/22, 12:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Contact*
11/20/22, 12:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This was the clue 😂
11/20/22, 13:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🙂
11/20/22, 13:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: That's weird
11/20/22, 13:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: And not innovative
11/20/22, 13:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Agreed
11/20/22, 13:07 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Then boys can't play this game right?
11/20/22, 13:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Last time they were told something about petrichor and Aleena's roll number I guess
11/20/22, 13:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Boys have to go to boys hostel to get another part of the clue
11/20/22, 13:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: One clue split into two parts
11/20/22, 13:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: One in girls side and other in boys side
11/20/22, 13:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Kimds these days
11/20/22, 13:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I was supposed to give the clue to them
11/20/22, 13:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was hilarious
11/20/22, 13:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oo, I see, still using room of seniors is not really a good idea
11/20/22, 13:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I had to escape from my room to the adjacent room
11/20/22, 13:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why though? We're present in the room when they come
11/20/22, 13:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And my roommate was watching, so I left the hostel as a decoy
11/20/22, 13:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And then returned after 10 min. I also had to keep my shows inside their room 😂
11/20/22, 13:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Still some people might not like visitors in there room, especially there are 2 stakeholders in each room
11/20/22, 13:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I agree. Here I guess both people agreed (not really, I didn't know this until morning 5:30)
11/20/22, 13:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I later asked my roommate if she was okay with it. She didn't have any issues
11/20/22, 13:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Good if like that
11/20/22, 13:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I think names were suggested by some common friends
11/20/22, 13:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: @919188011081 did you know about this clue thing before I told you?
11/20/22, 13:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We were abruptly added to a group
11/20/22, 13:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: No
11/20/22, 13:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 13:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 13:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Does today's raita have onions?

11/20/22, 13:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 14:27 - Saamp🐍: Nopoe
11/20/22, 14:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It had onions. I ate just pappadum with poori and little bit of biryani 😌
11/20/22, 16:56 - Saamp🐍: Idk If I told you guys or not
11/20/22, 16:56 - Saamp🐍: But I lub onion and garlic
11/20/22, 16:57 - Saamp🐍: But because of sneha 🥲 and the way the cut onions like string and in excess amount even I started hating it
11/20/22, 18:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 18:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Oiii, what did I do 😂
11/20/22, 18:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I just expressed my disapproval
11/20/22, 18:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't intend it to affect your palette 🥲
11/20/22, 18:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I approve of the ginger
11/20/22, 18:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I approve of the garlic too, just that it's not my personal preference
11/20/22, 18:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 18:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've not seen a paper based study material anywhere in a long time 😂
11/20/22, 18:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: @919205513216 have you visited college street?
11/20/22, 18:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I want to go there now
11/20/22, 18:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: What college street?🥲
11/20/22, 18:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Delhi?
11/20/22, 18:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Street_(Kolkata)
11/20/22, 18:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Oyyo, no. I don't even know if Delhi has a college street
11/20/22, 18:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My father would buy me books from there, second hand books
11/20/22, 18:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Demm, I did, I forgot so easily 🥲
11/20/22, 18:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They have a unique smell. They smell like college street 😌
11/20/22, 18:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 18:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: College street smells of books
11/20/22, 18:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You must go there
11/20/22, 18:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: @919188011081 let's go to Kolkata. Tvm is too near 😂
11/20/22, 18:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Kolkata or Kochi 😌
Either near or far 😌
11/20/22, 18:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
11/20/22, 18:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I want to go on a long trip with friends (I know it's not feasible)
11/20/22, 18:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Long matlab it should be challenging for everyone in the group
11/20/22, 18:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It should be far from home
11/20/22, 18:19 - Saamp🐍: There may be people who'll think kochi is far so your statement is not valid
11/20/22, 18:19 - Saamp🐍: Road trip to spain

12/4/22, 19:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You should mention that na 😂
12/4/22, 19:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: People will now search for a navy blue umbrella

12/4/22, 19:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There isn't a wrong answer, but how well you justify yourself
12/4/22, 19:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This rote version of ethics ain't ideal

12/6/22, 22:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've already mentioned that I've used certain parts of my paper as reference
12/6/22, 22:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Quillbot is useless. I write better and faster
12/6/22, 22:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I got it down to 9% with my own paper and 19% overall
12/6/22, 22:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This 9% is a table I took from wiki that I used last time too and all my references and citations from the previous paper
12/6/22, 22:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ooo
12/6/22, 22:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: That's fine ig

12/7/22, 00:07 - Saamp🐍: Piroooo
12/7/22, 00:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
12/7/22, 19:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: what comes with no effort is of no use 👀
12/7/22, 19:57 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Day by day AI is going powerful in future it can write better than humans, what will make difference is biases, Current AI's have liberal bias and this can be harnessed as a way to stay relevant by human writers
12/7/22, 20:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🗡️
12/7/22, 20:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There is no such thing as a true synonym 🥲
12/7/22, 20:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If you read my previous paper and this paper, you'll clearly be able to see that the previous one flows better. It's better in every way for the duplicated parts. Every part of a sentence is important to give human meaning to it
12/7/22, 20:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: When you change a word to a synonym, you pull the sentence apart and then patch it up together. That's never the same as before, and rarely better (provided the first sentence was well written)
12/7/22, 20:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True true

12/8/22, 14:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Or it doesn't reflect on my paper

12/8/22, 14:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Everyone around me had more than me
12/8/22, 14:47 - Saamp🐍: Change college
12/8/22, 14:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Everyone I asked has more than me 😂
12/8/22, 14:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nope, I want to do well here

12/8/22, 14:48 - Saamp🐍: Ayyy you don't spell it out

Commenting on the general status of lottery sales, gov's stance on it and public reception to it, what do you think?
12/8/22, 20:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Dear all,
We have received complaints that few students at Ahalia are facing health issues related to stomach upset. We are monitoring the situation and nothing is serious. The mess managers have been instructed and measures are in place.

In addition, diminished immunity due to the end semester exam stress in some students and as a consequence, modification in intestinal microbiota might have also contributed to the problem.

Thank you,
Jagadeesh

I'm suffering from chronic diarrhea from some ingredient in the food I couldn't figure out yet. I lost a lot of my strength as I couldn't even lift my luggage with one hand up the flyover, something I could do with ease 3 months ago. And my bag isn't even that heavy this time
12/15/22, 20:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Suffering is permanent, indeed. But I really need a break. Things got out of hand last month. Revealing gory details will only make all of you uncomfortable

12/16/22, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Last Sat was biter gourd. I don't know why they told me it was so good and I came later just to try it out. It was horrid. I think they just took my word that I like my bitter gourd 'bitter', they ignored the sheer amount of oil and onions in it
12/16/22, 00:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was distraught that I tried to segregate them but then left it. There wasn't much hope 🥲
12/16/22, 00:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's a rare incident of course. Sometimes it happens that I take stuff and have to throw it all away because I can't get myself to take a lump of that food and put it into my mouth
12/16/22, 00:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🤧
12/16/22, 00:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Points 6, 7 and 8 seem to be able to be merged into 1

12/16/22, 01:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Now my aatma is asking its physical embodiment to sleep
12/16/22, 01:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nope
12/16/22, 01:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Google drive is also hosted in some server
12/16/22, 01:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You just don't see it
12/16/22, 11:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I slept for 9 hours

12/16/22, 11:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Could be placebo

The recent one was convenient to tie up and not comb for days
12/17/22, 18:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I always used to partition my hair to the left
12/17/22, 18:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And my hair isn't this straight. It curls at the ends
12/17/22, 18:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Probably no. I'm scared of uncooked eggs
12/17/22, 18:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'll quote Susan doing a symbolic mic drop by just keeping the mic on the floor, gently, "else cfet will kill me".

12/17/22, 19:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: On the way we were stopped by my Father's old friend. His name is Rajappan Nair. Legend says that everyone has a Raju in their life. In 10 minutes what I witnessed was epic. The battle of words between a wildly optimistic and a passive pessimistic individual. In those 10 minutes the optimist went through the 5 stages of grief
12/17/22, 19:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was sad and hilarious at the same time
12/17/22, 19:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He is very hopeful that something will become of the company. It was an iconic moment. This conversation happened just outside the gate, beside huge posters of the current ruling party.
12/17/22, 19:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He ended his argument with a revelation, something he realised but is scared of. My father scoffed when he asked my father not to reveal this to anyone. They can't do anything to us, max they can throw us out of our house. And what Raju uncle doesn't realise is that they can't do anything to him either
12/17/22, 19:07 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I'm packing up with this song in the background: https://youtu.be/PRVzHdgpLsA

12/17/22, 22:15 - Saamp🐍: <Media omitted>
12/17/22, 22:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How are plural word forms decided in Hindi?
12/17/22, 22:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Who all speak this language?
12/17/22, 22:15 - Saamp🐍: It's a fictional language
12/17/22, 22:15 - Saamp🐍: Used in star trek
12/17/22, 22:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
12/17/22, 22:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Indeed. This doubt has been troubling me for long
12/17/22, 22:16 - Saamp🐍: It's just e after singular 
Or ya after singular
12/17/22, 22:16 - Saamp🐍: I think it's based on gender or something?
12/17/22, 22:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And how is that decided?
12/17/22, 22:17 - Saamp🐍: Just like english
12/17/22, 22:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm asking you 😂

12/17/22, 22:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We usually add some possessive pronoun before
12/17/22, 22:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Makes sense
12/17/22, 22:20 - Saamp🐍: Gharo means in house
12/17/22, 22:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Very diplomatic
12/17/22, 22:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: if i'm not there, doesn't mean i wont know
12/17/22, 22:21 - Saamp🐍: One may doubt that it's plural
12/17/22, 22:21 - Saamp🐍: But it's not plural is just raja
12/17/22, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲

12/17/22, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No gender
12/17/22, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can speak about my boyfriend for hours
12/17/22, 22:21 - Saamp🐍: Honestly this is how languages are 🥲🥲

12/17/22, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's ehy I love it
12/17/22, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So easy to find reasons
12/17/22, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Even things that seem like exceptions have well defined rules
12/17/22, 22:22 - Saamp🐍: I like hindi cause it's hard for others to learn it's grammer 🌝
12/17/22, 22:23 - Saamp🐍: Which I already know
12/17/22, 22:23 - Saamp🐍: Similar to english

12/17/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🫠🫠🫠
12/17/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Can't even form proper sentences without messing up the verbs
12/17/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why are verbs gendered
12/17/22, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Makes no sense to me
12/17/22, 22:24 - Saamp🐍: That's just lack of practice
12/17/22, 22:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was searching for elements of gender in Bangla speech. I could find things on how people are treated
12/17/22, 22:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I understand but now things are out of hand 🥲
12/17/22, 22:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have to actually sit down and re-learn stuff

12/17/22, 22:26 - Saamp🐍: You are bihari right?
12/17/22, 22:26 - Saamp🐍: Or no?
12/17/22, 22:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm a non musician who needs fine tuners
12/17/22, 22:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How can dancing cause you to lose your integrity? Your not violating any rule or anybody by dancing. Doesn't make sense 🥲
12/17/22, 22:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>

12/17/22, 22:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yukta isn't my roommate

12/17/22, 23:56 - Saamp🐍: That place is...
12/17/22, 23:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Where knowledge is free
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
By narrow domestic walls
Where words come out from the depth of truth
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
Where the mind is led forward by thee
Into ever-widening thought and action
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

And then she shook it away
12/18/22, 23:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I understand 🥲
12/18/22, 23:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Anne Frank's diary is among the most heartfelt books I've read
12/18/22, 23:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I hate that school included Helen Keller's book in syllabus but not this. No offence to Keller. I would have preferred alternating between the books every year
12/18/22, 23:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Both are great books
12/18/22, 23:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Conspiracy engorced nationalism is recipe for disaster
12/18/22, 23:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Anne Frank's story also should be taught. My teacher said our school doesn't include it because of some references of teenage crushes etc...

12/19/22, 00:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
12/19/22, 00:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup. But it should be read 🥲
12/19/22, 00:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: We had both options, can choose any, the max chosen one will be taught in class
12/19/22, 00:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not that they actually taught the novels. We read it on our own

12/19/22, 00:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Illegitimate child, suicide etc.
12/19/22, 00:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: Oo. I remember. It was one of the bleak ones
12/19/22, 00:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Had very deep themes, but was a very short chap, 3 pages of my book
12/19/22, 00:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Mostly the same, though teacher gave idea what is important or like some discussion why this , plot construction etc
12/19/22, 00:04 - Lekshmi R Nair: People didn't understand it's brilliance
12/19/22, 00:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I prepared well. I wanted to do justice to that chapter

12/19/22, 00:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
12/19/22, 00:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Thankfully my autocorrect doesn't "correct" my text to more questionable thjngs
12/19/22, 00:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Your thjngs are not affected by autocorrect I see 😂
12/19/22, 00:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's not autocorrect. That's my poor typing 😂
12/19/22, 00:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Even Lekshmi's is probably that only. X and C are very close
12/19/22, 00:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yes

12/19/22, 00:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Saying a thought makes it reality?
12/19/22, 00:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: It makes it true that u r having it
12/19/22, 00:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: And people know about it
12/19/22, 00:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup 😂
They are independent beings in the truest sense

12/19/22, 00:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's sad that things have to be this way
12/19/22, 00:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why do we get distanced from parents after a certain age

12/19/22, 00:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Topper I 👀
12/19/22, 10:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Dear Amit,

Here are my comments. Because of my travels, I took few day to respond.

1. I do not comment on the old tenders. As I was not even in the Institute during those periods, it is not appropriate for me to comment. However, Dr. Anand has already written a detailed e-mail regarding that.
Also, the photos presented here are old and the Hostel secretary has already taken care of them. 

We are not favouring anybody rather going as per the rules and regulations. There is no agenda whatsoever. Make sure that all of you participate promptly for the surveys related to your life in the institute and in SAC elections for electing the student representatives including research scholar representative. 

Next year during March/April, we will be going for the new mess tender and make sure that you provide all your suggestions to the mess committee. The tender committee will weigh on various suggestions they receive and make a final tender document.

We cannot run two caterers currently due to obvious practical and logistic reasons. Once Phase 1B is complete, it will give an option to run two caterers. Also, more in the long run.

2. Coupon system is not feasible at this stage for practical and logistic reasons. When we have multiple caterers/more student strength, a coupen system can be introduced on a monthly basis. Scholars have representatives in the mess committee and make sure that you route your complaints through them. Next month onwards, the entire student community will get the mess committee meeting minutes and action taken.

Currently mess cuts can be availed three times in a semester provided students should not be in the campus for at least 4 days.

Inspection on the brands, quality of the material, expiry date.... are normally done by the representatives either before the opening of the mess or at the closure time to ensure that the cooking process is not disturbed.  In addition, for the daily inspection of stores and cold rooms, a checklist is being prepared and daily checks will be done by one of the mess committee members in both the campuses.

Only the suggestions that go with the tender agreement are considered. Please don't forget that tender documents abide by the government laws to protect both the clients and service providers. Some permutation combinations are possible. But suggestions like more chicken, unlimited eggs and others are not possible. You provide your views on fixed rate vs content rate next year when we call for a new tender. But we consider the entire student community while making a decision. The tender committee will weigh on various suggestions they receive and make a final tender document.

3. Mess committee will intervene here to ensure that the spice level is reduced.
@ Mess committee please take a note of this and take prompt action.
12/19/22, 10:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why are they so focused on spice?
12/19/22, 10:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Inspection on the brands, quality of the material, expiry date.... are normally done by the representatives either before the opening of the mess or at the closure time to ensure that the cooking process is not disturbed.
12/19/22, 10:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So the reps are so selfless that they get up at 6 in the morning to do an inspection? How come I've never heard of such inspections?
12/19/22, 10:34 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
12/19/22, 10:38 - Lekshmi R Nair: Also... Why 4 days
12/19/22, 10:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The 4 day thing makes no sense at all
12/19/22, 10:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Typically students leave for home every weekend on Friday evening and return by Sunday night
12/19/22, 10:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Rightfully should be counted as two days
12/19/22, 10:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But because of the system they'll count it as 1 🫠
12/19/22, 10:45 - Lekshmi R Nair: The thing is college is completely siding with mess

12/22/22, 18:08 - Lekshmi R Nair: I saw
12/22/22, 18:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It didn't work. The male was more interested in chewing the bamboo

12/26/22, 00:36 - Saamp🐍: Rich people are "allowed" to be stupid?

12/26/22, 00:39 - Saamp🐍: In order to get accepted in the society
12/26/22, 00:39 - Saamp🐍: Or anyway
12/26/22, 00:40 - Saamp🐍: You need to have some sense..
12/26/22, 00:40 - Saamp🐍: For example
12/26/22, 00:40 - Saamp🐍: Some common sense... Knowledge something you need in order to get accepted in the society
12/26/22, 00:40 - Saamp🐍: But provided you're rich
12/26/22, 00:40 - Saamp🐍: People still accepts you even if you're stupid
12/26/22, 00:40 - Saamp🐍: Does that make it clear?
12/26/22, 00:41 - Saamp🐍: Like if I'm rich and I'm stupid people won't accept me my opinions won't matter and they'll pretend like I don't even exist
12/26/22, 00:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes, clear

12/26/22, 00:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: sounding like a military strategist
12/26/22, 00:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you very much part of it
12/26/22, 00:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: @919499725866  The wealthy population are sometimes/ many times put up with. People will listen to them even if they make no sense at all. But if they actually are stupid, people know what they are doing. It's a conscious choice many people make maybe because of the benefits or because of their status in society or majboori. I have to think more in this
12/26/22, 00:53 - Saamp🐍: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cmf2oqHBsMF/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=
12/26/22, 00:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Imo this sometimes makes it difficult for them to filter people because they will find it difficult to know who is actually loyal to them/ their friend/ with them with no malicious intent
12/26/22, 00:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ever gone over the farakka barrage?
12/26/22, 00:54 - Saamp🐍: Interesting
12/26/22, 00:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Very diplomatic answer
12/26/22, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We remember. In words of homeopathy, water has memory and so do we
12/26/22, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What's your take?
12/26/22, 00:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm not rich so I can't exactly speak from their perspective. Neither do I have a very rich friend to give me insight into this
12/26/22, 00:57 - Saamp🐍: Lekshmi isn't your friend
12/26/22, 00:57 - Saamp🐍: ?
12/26/22, 00:57 - Amritanshu Raj CR: It is not necessarily true that wealthy individuals can afford to be stupid. While it is possible that some wealthy individuals may have the financial resources to insulate themselves from the negative consequences of their actions or poor decision-making, this does not mean that they can afford to be genuinely stupid in the sense of lacking intelligence or understanding.
It also goes to show that they lack confrontations and hence never do feedback based improvements. for poor it is absolutely necessary to be intelligent else survival comes under question.
Sometimes it is also that wealthy people aren't stupid they just pretend to be in order to reduce enemies, like they won't object if they are threatened by goons to pay something
12/26/22, 00:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If they even care or not. I'm drawing parallels to my experience in school. I will argue I was academically rich in school which leads me to these observations
12/26/22, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes she is, but she isn't rich
12/26/22, 00:58 - Saamp🐍: Ouch
12/26/22, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nice
12/26/22, 00:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i saw hirakund
12/26/22, 00:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
12/26/22, 00:59 - Saamp🐍: Ofcourse it's bad for them if they're stupid but my point is society will accept them as it is even though they're stupid
12/26/22, 01:00 - Saamp🐍: Okay okay got it
12/26/22, 01:00 - Saamp🐍: I mean to say
12/26/22, 01:00 - Saamp🐍: They get respect
12/26/22, 01:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I will still argue that sometimes the spouses and children of the rich (the person who is intelligent or is the source leading to wealth) can afford to be stupid
12/26/22, 01:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Noice
12/26/22, 01:00 - Saamp🐍: Society give rich people respect unconditionally
12/26/22, 01:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They will be shown to be accepted
12/26/22, 01:01 - Saamp🐍: Yeah that's the point I was trying to make 🥲
12/26/22, 01:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But what happens behind them 🫠
12/26/22, 01:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: what good you will bring by letting people know that thing which not necessarily reflect their reality but a fictious sarcastic joke which should be taken lightly by all stakeholders
12/26/22, 01:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: people get respected for the value they bring, the poor get respected only if they have some sparking skill or knowledge but rich enjoy the evergreen respect for the monetary value they bring on the table
12/26/22, 01:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: this is diplomacy 👀
12/26/22, 01:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: @919499725866
12/26/22, 01:04 - Saamp🐍: But like not every rich person donates or contributes towards society

12/26/22, 01:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: To the table, whose table? 😶‍🌫
12/26/22, 01:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Using flowery language to dismiss the matter. We shall not permit this
12/26/22, 01:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep, but due to potential benefits, money gets the respect and not necessarily the individual
12/26/22, 01:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: to table of conversing people
12/26/22, 01:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: objection rejected, you rich don't think much about these things
12/26/22, 01:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: *rich and intelligent

12/26/22, 01:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm not rich. Hence I will think. My thoughts make me human and my ability to express them keeps me sane
12/26/22, 01:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Losing the ability to think will be the end of humankind
12/26/22, 01:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Striking off rich is better damage control 😂

12/26/22, 01:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I remember having a checkered shirt somewhere. The two shirts I have in hostel are floral and don't look very formal

12/29/22, 23:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I stopped doing that now because I don't want another reason to fall sick
12/29/22, 23:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What can you do to me? 😂
12/29/22, 23:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: sea breeze is real thing i felt first time in kerala
12/29/22, 23:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sea breeze is salty when near the sea
12/29/22, 23:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Did you go near the sea?
12/29/22, 23:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Touch your face after one hour and you can feel the salt
12/29/22, 23:45 - Amritanshu Raj CR: sleeping inside a heavy blanket is a feeling in itself
12/29/22, 23:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: When I went home after my grandfather's death, in Dec
12/29/22, 23:45 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, life is tough in tropics 🥲
12/29/22, 23:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My mother would pile blanket after blanket on me
12/29/22, 23:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Maybe 4 blankets with sweater
12/29/22, 23:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Then she would tie a scarf around my neck and put a light towel over my face
12/29/22, 23:46 - Amritanshu Raj CR: trade-off can't have best of both
12/29/22, 23:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Rendering me immobile 😂
12/29/22, 23:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: depends
12/29/22, 23:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's tough there too. The cold makes you not want to work
12/29/22, 23:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: free minerals i see
12/29/22, 23:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They've given me the final warning. Otherwise they'll take the next step 😂
12/29/22, 23:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That means you can do nothing at all
12/29/22, 23:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup. Allow your face to be a mine
12/29/22, 23:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: not yet, but night reversal of winds in palakkad i felt, palakkad is important geographically as there is a gap b/w western ghats here and it funnels air into the gap due to orogenic factors making palakkad a high wind power potential place
12/29/22, 23:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: mini kejriwal i see
12/29/22, 23:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you be like:
12/29/22, 23:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Now that I picture it, damn. So hilariously accurate 😂
12/29/22, 23:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
12/29/22, 23:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True. Good analysis 🙏
12/29/22, 23:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We can notice it if you analyze the wind map too
12/29/22, 23:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Perks of reading Microsoft Bing's weather maps every now and then... 😂
12/29/22, 23:52 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but the sunlight is good, today i spent whole afternoon on roof recharging myself like a photovoltaic cell and reading some random stuff
12/29/22, 23:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
12/29/22, 23:53 - Amritanshu Raj CR: certainly can't do in kerala
12/29/22, 23:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also if your hostel roof open to you?
12/29/22, 23:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *is
12/29/22, 23:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I really enjoyed recording our ethics play in acad roof. I like rooftops. It's sad that the purpose of H3 makes is essential that we live without it 🥲
12/29/22, 23:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: what next step, make a cell of nets and imprison you for night
12/29/22, 23:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He roof door was next to my former room and I would stand there for the breeze looking out wishing to go out
12/29/22, 23:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nicee. Enjoy 🥺
12/29/22, 23:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We don't have roof. We have verandah and garden. My mother makes me sit their claiming that I'm already deficient in VitD. But I believe the sun is a bit too harsh 🥲
12/29/22, 23:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No. Take turns to stay awake and watch what I'm doing 🥲
12/29/22, 23:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: thats a self satisfying conclusion, I neither deny nor accept your conclusion on time i will make it clear what i meant, this is how nehru was deceived by China into 1950s nehru declared borders were finalised china neither denied nor accepted and kept building military in tibet and in 62 nehru led india to an  embarrassing defeat despite having a superior air-force and comparable army
12/29/22, 23:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i imagine gandhi ji doing dandi march with his face as the salt pan
12/29/22, 23:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
12/30/22, 00:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i see geographer
12/30/22, 00:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Happy Birthday
12/30/22, 00:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: it's better than chrome in many ways i have seen like reading pdfs etc
12/30/22, 00:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Very long historical episode 🥲
Why compare it with my probably correct conclusion 🫠
12/30/22, 00:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: not exactly but the key is similar to one of the rooms(not mine) so.........
12/30/22, 00:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's a hilarious thought 😂
12/30/22, 00:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Do you know about Vaikom Satyagraha (5-6km from my place)?
12/30/22, 00:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Calls me a geographer who forgot that ToC passes through Jharkhand and not Bihar
12/30/22, 00:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yesss. I always use edge for PDFs
12/30/22, 00:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, you should start treatment by knowing which deficiency you do not have, at this point
12/30/22, 00:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nice. A friend of mine claimed she found the key to H3 roof. But we never dared. I don't know if Lekshmi knows about this 😂
12/30/22, 00:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: next time ask em to buy a cage, will not ruin their sleep 🤣
12/30/22, 00:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't have any deficiency. My blood test came clean except for ESR 🥲
12/30/22, 00:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My mother treats me like her
12/30/22, 00:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I think she is forgetting that I'm 20 and she'll be 57 🥲
12/30/22, 00:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She shouldn't compare her risk to diseases and calcium deficiency with mine 🫠
12/30/22, 00:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: memory/cognitive deficiency 👀, consider sitting in sunlight 🤣
12/30/22, 00:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i just couldn't control, i recent read somewhere what silence means in chinese diplomacy
12/30/22, 00:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>

12/30/22, 00:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
12/30/22, 00:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I sit outside a lot and go on two walks per day. That's enough sunlight 🥲
12/30/22, 00:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: what makes me angry is Nehru's desperateness to establish relation with China, I would never welcome someone who doesn't respects my territorial integrity, if blood is going to be spilled i will prefer victory
12/30/22, 00:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Nehru's china policy was equivalent to a teenage one-sided lover
12/30/22, 00:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nice. You're a well read person. I'm trying to catch up on the news these days. The Vox 2022 recap video gave me goosebumps. I truly missed a lot
12/30/22, 00:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've never heard a better description I'll admit 😂
12/30/22, 00:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: a cage a day (actually night) keeps mosquito away
12/30/22, 00:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I agree (with whatever limited knowledge I have about history 🥲)
12/30/22, 00:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: good for you
12/30/22, 00:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, you will heal, earth is healing
12/30/22, 00:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, vox makes good documentaries
12/30/22, 00:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We sometimes tie it during the day too. After the company fell they stopped doing pest control. There are mosquito breeding grounds which we can't do anything about
12/30/22, 00:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't know about that. Sun won't heal my stomach or even skin 🥲
I ignored the warning signs. Now I feel I should have gone to a doctor in October itself. I waited too long
12/30/22, 00:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
12/30/22, 00:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that's what it was, it costed us relations with Taiwan, the buffer state of Tibet, The kailash mansaroovar (we had it during Ranjit singhs rule and historical claims could have been made), it costed us over five thousand soldiers who were sent without proper snow clothing and many died due to frostbite, even today we get bodies of our men when the snow melts, It costed us akshai chin, it costed self confidence....
12/30/22, 00:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5fFn2vF2MvF9Cf6RnaoSZQj
I liked this one a lot
12/30/22, 00:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, what doesn't kills me makes me strong i would repeat, lesson for next time
12/30/22, 00:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's a huge toll for stupidity 🥲
12/30/22, 00:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: forensic science i see
12/30/22, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: When people at the center lead to such blatant stupidity, I can only wonder how they came to power, here became the prime minister 🥲
12/30/22, 00:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The how is history. Hopefully nothing like that will ever repeat
12/30/22, 00:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What doesn't kill leaves scars 🥲
Yes, it is a lesson for next time and hopefully that next time won't come 🥲
12/30/22, 00:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: The list doesn't stops here, it took us more than 50 years only after kargil we had the courage that with proper investment into infra we can counter them in the mountains, It costed us glaciers of upper himalayas which are important source of water and all south asian states including china would have been in a inferior position if we would have mounted them with our soldiers
12/30/22, 00:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: he was way too desperate for noble
12/30/22, 00:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True 🥲 I can't say anything to supplement. Little knowledge
12/30/22, 00:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Personal motives over country
12/30/22, 00:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: early independent india, we lost or were forced to forget about SC bose atleast he was a more courageous and realistic leader even gandhi would have been better but he choose to not become and we ended up with him though not all his policies were wrong but some were terrible
12/30/22, 00:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I feel we aren't taught enough about Bose. Our textbooks largely ignore him
12/30/22, 00:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: good thing is internet, people now have access to info else what was happening in delhi has very diff than what was happening in a farmer's life in far fetched village
12/30/22, 00:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And portray him as a radical who was against Gandhi. Gandhi being the only good. So his ways weren't right. And this is how most of my friends in school felt
12/30/22, 00:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
12/30/22, 00:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents told me about Bose and I learnt more. My mother frequently curses Nehru and talks about Bose at every opportunity (also any Bengali freedom fighter)
12/30/22, 00:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: one thing in diplomacy is that there are no emotions, only interests, only fools will bring relations into diplomacy, that is applicable for ages
12/30/22, 00:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True true
12/30/22, 00:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Internet opens eyes
12/30/22, 00:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True 🥲
12/30/22, 00:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You can compile all of your messages into an essay
12/30/22, 00:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The moment we bring relations into it there is space for exploitation 🫠
It's a balance. We have to be vigilant to keep the rope taut so that it doesn't slip from our hands
12/30/22, 00:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: it's all about seeking concessions, avoid making concessions,. Having superior position is always helpful and one must not never let eagerness come into diplomacy, eagerness is a sign of weakness, psychological posturing is equally imp
12/30/22, 00:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Me terrible at history. You have to do with my sub standard replies to keep up the conversation. Although I don't you care 😂
12/30/22, 00:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *Think
12/30/22, 00:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: it was done deliberately. The nehruvian administration spied upon bose's family. height of shamelessness
12/30/22, 00:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Eagerness? Please elaborate with example 🫠
You mean one must not seem too eager? Too desperate? Once they seem so they lose the upper hand? 🫠
12/30/22, 00:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh, didn't know about the spying part 🥲
12/30/22, 00:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sadly we still use those text books
12/30/22, 00:40 - Amritanshu Raj CR: There can't be one way to resistance against a colonizer. If you see Gandhi's life in SouthAfrica he can be seen as racist (against blacks) indian historians skipped this part as it didn't fit the narrative but bose was deliberately portrayed as radical even though what he did was just to stand up for his people and led a frontal military compain for independence
12/30/22, 00:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True true
12/30/22, 00:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Textbooks portray Gandhi as sort of a messiah, not exactly but along those lines
12/30/22, 00:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: History modified to suit the narrative and people who don't go on to read more after school will continue to think along those lines
12/30/22, 00:44 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep, the eagerness show was such that when nehru wished to establish relations with communist regime in china, no other country did till them and the onus was on china to reachout but now the chinese knew how eager Nehru was and hence asked india to send a representative in china to establish ties and nehru did so, recognition was the need of the hour of china but they still didn't bowed down and Nehru went flat in front of them
12/30/22, 00:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: no one did, a letter was leaked in 2014-15 i guess in which ib director in kolkata was asking if to continue the spying on bose family (in 1960s ig) an even more controversial letter of nehru has leaked on bose but no confirmation is there but ib spying is well known now
12/30/22, 00:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: someone in ib told bose family about this stating his ethics has died to extent it has died in Delhi
12/30/22, 00:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
12/30/22, 00:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: indians love messiahs
12/30/22, 00:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Stupidity 🥲
12/30/22, 00:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but also one must take in account take history is a source of lesson and not hate
12/30/22, 00:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh. Didn't know about this either. Thanks for sharing 🥲
12/30/22, 00:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
12/30/22, 00:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/declassified-files-show-netaji-subash-chandra-boses-family-spied-on-in-independent-india/articleshow/49018328.cms?from=mdr
12/30/22, 00:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The messiah narrative is very black and white. We should accept that everything is a shade of grey and so should be how we view this world and the people we read about
12/30/22, 00:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: "True true. One must not repeat the same mistakes and that's why we learn history", my 6th standard SSc teacher used to say this
12/30/22, 00:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Nehru's another issue was that he hated most of the competent officers of Indian armed forces leading to accumulations of chaplooses in the his close giving a very false picture of the military preparedness. He loved people who bowed down in front of him, He hated field marshall Sam manek saw, Km karriapa etc ...
12/30/22, 00:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: we still aren't able to fix history revolving around mughals a section of historians think mughals were messiah, that's why i saw we love to become subjects of master
12/30/22, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Thanks for sharing. Good to see no "get premium" popup 😶‍🌫
12/30/22, 00:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep, those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it
12/30/22, 01:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've read a lot about Sam manekshaw. Makes sense that Nehru would hate him 😂
12/30/22, 01:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's not how the government should have been working. 🥲
We need opposing and strong people around to keep you in check
12/30/22, 01:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He does seem like a teenager who came to power 🥲
12/30/22, 01:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: That's why nehru couldn't have liberated East pakistan and Indra despite having a mixed relationship with him did so
12/30/22, 01:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because of Mughal history being most of the textbook we learn little about others. Other important rulers are just mentioned 🥲
12/30/22, 01:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
12/30/22, 01:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I call him Indian (more democratic) Stali
12/30/22, 01:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: *Stalin
12/30/22, 01:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: as i said

12/30/22, 01:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: another temsion, now India have better chances of fairing against china as empowered citizens and the collective will to make no more concessions to them
12/30/22, 01:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: gol-gol

12/30/22, 10:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: A short poem on winter in Kerala 

Winter in Kerala,  it gets too cold
With 32 degrees, so so cold
12/30/22, 10:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm compelled to recite a longer poem now
12/30/22, 10:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was Kerala, in the boughs of the tropics
Winter descended
Days got shorter
Nights got longer
But people unperturbed
Continued with higher
Winter was sadder
"My wrath means nothing", said she dejected
With that she left
But who noticed her passing?
Guess away 🙃
12/30/22, 10:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Continued on, higher
12/30/22, 10:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I tried to maintain a rhyme scheme. Failed miserably in the end 🥲
12/30/22, 10:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But if you read it in a certain fashion it does seem poetic 🥲
12/30/22, 10:47 - Lekshmi R Nair: Now I feel like a kid
12/30/22, 10:47 - Lekshmi R Nair: Byebye

12/30/22, 10:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why 😂
12/30/22, 10:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Just about any mala?
12/30/22, 10:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Climb over Himalaya

12/30/22, 23:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because it's necessitated
12/30/22, 23:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I will argue the total is more or less the same when you sum over all chats
12/30/22, 23:46 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that sign shows he spoiled brat
12/30/22, 23:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh, interesting conclusion
12/30/22, 23:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You have anthropomorphised a carton of milk
12/30/22, 23:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't you see it's an illusion
12/30/22, 23:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's how you see it too

12/30/22, 23:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And not just how I told you to see it
12/30/22, 23:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I didn't mean to say that I feel pressurized to make profane jokes because of my surroundings 😂
12/30/22, 23:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I hope I never reach that point
12/30/22, 23:48 - Lekshmi R Nair: https://youtube.com/shorts/f949u1rr3DA?feature=share
12/30/22, 23:48 - Lekshmi R Nair: Profane joke
12/30/22, 23:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: depends on this grp's weightage in total conversations you have
12/30/22, 23:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Bro noo
12/30/22, 23:48 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂
12/30/22, 23:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I washed my eyes once 🥲
12/30/22, 23:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: Wash again
12/30/22, 23:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: Emjoy
12/30/22, 23:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What did you make me see
12/30/22, 23:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: Komedy

12/30/22, 23:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup, this indeed is true evil
12/30/22, 23:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: whataboutism i see
12/30/22, 23:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: A lot, but I'm not talking much to my other friends. Just 2 other chats maybe
12/30/22, 23:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, need to curb my joke else may face fury
12/30/22, 23:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
12/30/22, 23:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But that brings an important question to me
12/30/22, 23:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Have my standards changed from before?
12/30/22, 23:52 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
12/30/22, 23:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I used to find slangs and cuss words on people especially transitionally disadvantaged groups unacceptable
12/30/22, 23:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I still firmly refrain from using any of them
12/30/22, 23:52 - Amritanshu Raj CR: on diet thing read this: https://www.universal-sci.com/article/origin-of-human-large-brains
12/30/22, 23:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I have become more accepting of others using them in our conversations
12/30/22, 23:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I remember telling this to Lekshmi a year ago. Perhaps someday everything we are against now will seem acceptable. Because people around us find it acceptable. We will become them.
12/30/22, 23:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i'm reading sapiens now, the article kind of extends some of the points author made in the book
12/30/22, 23:55 - Amritanshu Raj CR: can't curb what others pitching
12/30/22, 23:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Will read tomorrow. I read a lot of medical terminology and literature today. Can't process new in for 5 hours
12/30/22, 23:55 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i may made dark jokes but avoid slangs mostly
12/30/22, 23:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: why? doing mbbs as side hustle
12/30/22, 23:56 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
12/30/22, 23:57 - Amritanshu Raj CR: good cardiologist in night, engineer in day, ways to become superrich
12/30/22, 23:57 - Amritanshu Raj CR: *good,
12/30/22, 23:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I used to think I should formulate my peers in a way to positively reinforce my traits. But a lot of my friends swear 😂
And they are good people. But I am very aware of the language I use and I would like people to think twice. I may offend a lot of people now 😂
12/30/22, 23:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also that. I've become a proponent in dark humour. Most times it's a political or social allegory. But sometimes it's very dark and I take a step back
12/30/22, 23:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i had plans to go bodhgaya but now covid break there, east asian monks and tourists came for a fest
12/30/22, 23:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nope. Learning about my condition and my parents conditions and gathering more info to educate myself from reliable sources including textbools
12/31/22, 00:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nope nope. Just a bit more to learn about what happened and why
12/31/22, 00:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: people don't like to be formulated, you do you, i do me is the key
12/31/22, 00:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
12/31/22, 00:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Gaya is a nice and calm place. Loved it
12/31/22, 00:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: my jokes are not dark they are light grey to be precise
12/31/22, 00:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Formulate as in surround myself with people who are naturally positively reinforcing how I am. Not that I want to try to change people
12/31/22, 00:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, self conscious topper i see
12/31/22, 00:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: not true but i will not oppose as i was going to visit
12/31/22, 00:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
12/31/22, 00:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, this makes more sense, but if you start neat picking people you will be left alone in the end
12/31/22, 00:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *Bodhgaya
12/31/22, 00:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I correct myself. Gaya is the dirtiest place cum city I've been to
12/31/22, 00:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: good that you didn't come to my home district, hope is still left
12/31/22, 00:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup and I want my thoughts to be challenged. Only then can I grow. I need a diverse group of people around me 😂
12/31/22, 00:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Which district? 😂
12/31/22, 00:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Where do you plan to settle in the future? There itself? Or somewhere else in Bihar? Or somewhere else entirely?
12/31/22, 00:07 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, but what good people who swear will bring
12/31/22, 00:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I feel I do have a diverse bunch around me. People with different thought processes. I watch and learn and understand them
12/31/22, 00:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
12/31/22, 00:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: this: https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
12/31/22, 00:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You mean to ask, 'what good will people who swear bring' or 'what good people who swear bring'? 🥲
12/31/22, 00:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 1
12/31/22, 00:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's rick roll
12/31/22, 00:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I admit I clicked
12/31/22, 00:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: not bihar to be sure
12/31/22, 00:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Noice. I recommend you stay away from WB at at any cost
12/31/22, 00:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: People who swear aren't only that they swear. They are much more. Everyone has a lot to offer
12/31/22, 00:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i gotcha
12/31/22, 00:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
12/31/22, 00:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i'm good at creating suspense and then making fun, remember the "meow" book
12/31/22, 00:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i will
12/31/22, 00:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but still better than Bihar
12/31/22, 00:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: *much
12/31/22, 00:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Swearing is a form of expression. There are many creative aspects to it. But at the same time there are stages and boundaries and as I said I'm very aware of what I speak and the language I use in general. And other people aren't, and that's fine
12/31/22, 00:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
12/31/22, 00:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Your jokes are getting old and predictable
12/31/22, 00:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: this is equivalent to realpolitik in diplomacy
12/31/22, 00:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't really have a metric to compare. I was in Bihar for maybe 5 days 😂
12/31/22, 00:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
12/31/22, 00:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The garlic has a lot of offer even if I don't like it
12/31/22, 00:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have to google what that is
12/31/22, 00:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interesting
12/31/22, 00:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: wow, even swearing can be seen with such holistic approach i didn't know
12/31/22, 00:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: maybe time has come for me to start swearing
12/31/22, 00:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
12/31/22, 00:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Try it. I challenge you 😂
12/31/22, 00:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: trust me, i have
12/31/22, 00:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If you cross the threshold you may get used to it
12/31/22, 00:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: finally realism in your approach, home food helped you get over garlic-phobia
12/31/22, 00:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: just like anything else i say or do 😎
12/31/22, 00:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm largely against swears that are offensive. I'm of the opinion that there are many more creative ways to express your frustration and feelings. Swears in a way can make you limited and hold you back from rhetoric
12/31/22, 00:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i won't, i take principled stands can't let anger take over me
12/31/22, 00:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'll say Assam is better 🥲
12/31/22, 00:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ayyo we don't eat onion garlic at home 😂

12/31/22, 00:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i won't initiate forget breaching threshold
12/31/22, 00:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Clever argument to refuse 😂
12/31/22, 00:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: now that i hinted i may swear you took one step back
12/31/22, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
12/31/22, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sad, I thought I had you there 👀
12/31/22, 00:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I know you won't swear
12/31/22, 00:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I swear more than you and when I do the world listens
12/31/22, 00:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: blasphemy i committed
12/31/22, 00:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I usually do so to make a point or imitate or quote someone or to highlight the seriousness of the situation
12/31/22, 00:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: as often with my refusals 😎
12/31/22, 00:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You did. No onion or garlic at home. Partial Jain food and I realised my parents stopped potatoes too. I deserve a break 😂
12/31/22, 00:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Bengalis can't live without potatoes. But here we are
12/31/22, 00:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you just can't, my patience is explained here: https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
12/31/22, 00:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Or sometimes when I am in shock (this statement is damage control, otherwise people will find all my swear filled messages)
12/31/22, 00:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: first time i agree with you
12/31/22, 00:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: spoiled milk brat i see
12/31/22, 00:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I memorize long passwords. I have the short term memory for this 😂
12/31/22, 00:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
12/31/22, 00:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interesting. Stalin ka chamcha agrees with me on something 😂
12/31/22, 00:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: highlighting a quote with slurs noice
12/31/22, 00:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You should watch. The world momentarily halts to process what just happened. It has a huge effect. I maybe exaggerating and I don't want others here to bring up instances when I sweated 😂
12/31/22, 00:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: ask parents are they creating concentration camp that too German? 🥲
12/31/22, 00:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: in y opinion proves only one that:
12/31/22, 00:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nooooo. The food is good. It's heaven. Quantity is pathetic. But quality is amazing. My stomach needs to heal. My small intestine is covered in ulcers 🥲
Had to thrust a 2 metre pipe into my butt to figure it out and then many complications that followed 🥲
12/31/22, 00:32 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>

12/31/22, 07:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: The thing Amritanshu, I suspect, is slowly turning to be...
12/31/22, 07:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
12/31/22, 08:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm seeing signs in him
12/31/22, 08:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've rarely been wrong about this matter. It's crucial for my existence here 😶‍🌫
12/31/22, 08:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
12/31/22, 08:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You know, once they came to power in the company their trade unions joined forces with them and now it's the people who are suffering
12/31/22, 08:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We had a milma store selling milk and ice cream etc. They cut his electricity off because he refused to pay (earlier he didn't have to pay). He was a hardcore co..... Now he started an electronics repair store at the same place and curses people

12/31/22, 11:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It can be interpreted in multiple ways, but I'm humbled that you see a raven in me
12/31/22, 11:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The common crow is incredibly intelligent for a bird
12/31/22, 11:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And it also has the ability to peck you to death
12/31/22, 11:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Imagine the headlines, man pecked to death by a crow. Face unidentifiable. Trying to trace family

1/1/23, 00:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Let me share my poem on this occasion
1/1/23, 00:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Please do
1/1/23, 00:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: As the old year fades away,
And the new one comes to stay,
I am filled with joy and cheer,
For the friends I hold so dear.

Like the stars that dot the sky,
Their friendship shines bright and high,
Guiding me through every turn,
Their love and support forever burn.

So here's a toast to you, my friends,
May the new year bring you joy that never ends,
May all your dreams and wishes come true,
As we journey together, me and you.

And as the frosty nights give way
To the warmth of a new day,
I am grateful for the bond we share,
A bond that will always be there.

So raise a glass and let us cheer,
To a new year, full of love and cheer,
To the friends who mean the world to me,
Here's to a happy new year, and may it be.
1/1/23, 00:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Let me share an anecdote, what my mother did yesterday
1/1/23, 00:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She went for a haircut. Later she had to pee
1/1/23, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So she entered a bar, very normal
1/1/23, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She saw many young folks there drinking
1/1/23, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She started talking to them and tried to convince them not to drink
1/1/23, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They didn't listen of course and told her their life struggles
1/1/23, 00:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Now, this is what my mother told me. Not sure if this is how it actually played out 🫠
1/1/23, 00:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: The bar owners let her do all this 👀
1/1/23, 00:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup. Nobody can stop her from doing anything
1/1/23, 00:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She is the grey haired angry old lady who pretends she can't understand Malayalam
1/1/23, 00:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I don't find it difficult to believe what she said either
1/1/23, 00:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Entirely plausible from what I know about her
1/1/23, 00:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: convincing a drunk man that drinking is bad always ends up with the conclusion that all things in life are bad and hence drinking is justified
1/1/23, 00:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Depends really
1/1/23, 00:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't think you have experience
1/1/23, 00:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
1/1/23, 00:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is lovely. Thanks for sharing
1/1/23, 00:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, not a good place for a women to be honest, in bihar alcohol is banned but before we didn't had bars we had 'addas' and those were highly unsafe for female
1/1/23, 00:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: lately i had started developing skills in rhyming
1/1/23, 00:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: max experience to cough syrup that to 40 ml, not more than that
1/1/23, 00:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I agree. She looks over 60. Of course if I narrated this story to her from my experience then I'd be sitting outside the house trying to make a fire with twigs
1/1/23, 00:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 40ml of cough syrup? How many spoons is that?
1/1/23, 00:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Alcohol is banned? I didn't know thay
1/1/23, 00:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: *10ml
1/1/23, 00:32 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 10 ml a time, 40 ml a day
1/1/23, 00:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/1/23, 00:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, spreading awareness is a very good characteristic of an ideal citizen but sometimes modulating urges to spread awareness is good for survival
1/1/23, 00:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 4 ig
1/1/23, 00:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also what she finally told me is never to enter a bar. All stunts she performs are under expert supervision
1/1/23, 00:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: it's banned legally but available easily as you can expect in Bihar
1/1/23, 00:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Oooo. Last year in December I got a terrible cough which was made worse by my tonsillitis
1/1/23, 00:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Oooo.
Is alcohol and such stuff in the state list? Also what is this matter called? 🥲
1/1/23, 00:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She also tried wine and beer before. She almost fainted 🫠
1/1/23, 00:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but why, even in Bengal i doubt alcoholics would not be very polite
1/1/23, 00:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/1/23, 00:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Kerala is good in these things people are tolerant
1/1/23, 00:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Of course she won't try this stunt elsewhere. This was in broad daylight in an open semi-bar kind of place with security. I think she entered some hotel kind of place
1/1/23, 00:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep, banning alcohol is one of the gandhian principle for social reforms (included in dpsp even i ain't wrong) alcohol lies in state list even in gujrat alcohol is banned as home state of gandhi
1/1/23, 00:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Depends on person to person. Under the influence of alcohol one can do anything
1/1/23, 00:40 - Amritanshu Raj CR: very adventurous i must say
1/1/23, 00:40 - Amritanshu Raj CR: see this: Thank you bhaijan, allah aap pe bhi mehar farmaaye is naye saal me
1/1/23, 00:44 - Amritanshu Raj CR: do you what 3 things a man(now read a person) should avoid in kalyug?
1/1/23, 00:44 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep this is but alcoholics are weak if you are strong men, they can't do much
1/1/23, 00:45 - Amritanshu Raj CR: *man/woman
1/1/23, 00:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhhh. Didn't know about the dosp thing 🫠
1/1/23, 00:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The case of Gujarat is pretty famous. Didn't know about Bihar 😂
1/1/23, 00:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She is. Once she tried wine given in her office on Christmas and she almost fainted on the train back. She was unable to walk properly and others had to help her. She didn't drink much, only a few sips but alcohol tolerance is low 🥲
1/1/23, 00:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes, what about this?
1/1/23, 00:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What all?
1/1/23, 00:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: reply to happy new year messages
1/1/23, 00:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: in bihar we call it sharabbandi
1/1/23, 00:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't know about that. Depends on circumstances greatly
1/1/23, 00:53 - Amritanshu Raj CR: except the ruling party people themselves promote smuggling, the ownership alcohol business has been shifted from the state to the party
1/1/23, 00:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes, but how does it fit in with everything else? 😂
1/1/23, 00:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🫠🫠🫠
1/1/23, 00:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i see, wine is actually good for show piece, rich people have rare wine in their closets
1/1/23, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We also have a bottle of wine
1/1/23, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My father got it from somewhere
1/1/23, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He brought it home
1/1/23, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 8 years back maybe 😂
1/1/23, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's still there
1/1/23, 00:55 - Amritanshu Raj CR: checkout on net, though its mostly from a man's perspective still the gold point would be applicable on women
1/1/23, 00:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I would prefer other artistic decorative pieces 😂
1/1/23, 00:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: just comedy nothing serious
1/1/23, 00:57 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i see, alcohol becomes necessity for people in colder regions, strongest alcohol is vodka famous in russia
1/1/23, 00:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: try a sip or two someday comrade 👀
1/1/23, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh. Internet me 5 hai
Jewelry, liquor, illicit relationship, quarrel and violence

1/1/23, 00:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This message was deleted
1/1/23, 01:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: this is simplified version i guess, 3rd point was that to avoid brothels
1/1/23, 01:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Russians are a different breed. Google or Youtube "a normal day in Russia"
1/1/23, 01:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: this is absurd never heard
1/1/23, 01:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nope. My mother's stories are a lesson to me. And I will not be kicked out if I return drunk. But what happens after the hangover is a different thing. 🥲
1/1/23, 01:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Moreover I don't want to drink. Not good for my liver
1/1/23, 01:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Black buck wants to see you 👀
1/1/23, 01:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i wanna buy my own tank 👀
1/1/23, 01:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhhh. There are different versions all over the internet 🥲
1/1/23, 01:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/1/23, 01:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's the most absurd thing I've read in years 🫠
1/1/23, 01:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: ask him to come to my house, i will place it on that wall from where it can see me all day, win win for both (me and buck) of us
1/1/23, 01:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: ig i heard 3 points:

1/1/23, 01:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This message was deleted
1/1/23, 01:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: leave it, not worth it, we see things not as they are, we see things as we are (on the author of that post)

1/1/23, 01:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Police want to see you now 😂
1/1/23, 01:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Google can lead you to strange places 🥲
1/1/23, 01:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: my mother wanted me to wear a gold locket, i refused due to safety reasons then realised maybe the 3 recommended restrictions have some reason
1/1/23, 01:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The Sanskrit won't leave my memory for sometime now 🥲
1/1/23, 01:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i don't wanna see them
1/1/23, 01:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but not even to the wild west where bing can
1/1/23, 01:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/1/23, 01:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There was a physicist too. Viktor Toth I believe. He has some amazing answers too. I've read answers analysing their science and especially physics curriculum and books
1/1/23, 01:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: they did some great stuff in classical physics i believe
1/1/23, 01:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interesting. My mother wants me to wear a locket too 🫠
Earlier I had a solver earring. She says the daughter of the house shouldn't be wearing silver. They must have some gold so after one year of bickering, I agreed to change to a gold one 😂🥲
1/1/23, 01:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't usually use Bing for search
1/1/23, 01:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Comrades, as we stand on the threshold of a new year, I am filled with hope and confidence in the future. For despite the challenges and struggles of the past year, we have proven ourselves to be a strong and united community.

Together, we have overcome obstacles and achieved great victories. We have worked tirelessly to build a society that is just and fair for all, and we have made great strides towards that goal.

But our work is not yet done. There are still those who seek to divide us and undermine our progress. And so, as we enter the new year, I call upon each and every one of you to redouble your efforts and stand strong against those who would seek to do us harm.

Let us work together to build a brighter future for ourselves and for all animals. Let us show the world what we are capable of achieving when we stand united and determined.

And so, as we raise our voices in a chorus of solidarity, let us embrace the new year with hope and determination. Together, we will overcome any obstacle and achieve greatness.

Long live Animal Farm! Long live the revolution! Happy New Year, comrades.
1/1/23, 01:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes. They did a lot of work in physics in general. And they still do

1/1/23, 01:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Elaborate 😂
1/1/23, 01:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Did you write this? 😂
1/1/23, 01:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: what they contributing to students and engineering is unclear, all they do is to wish on now and then like rivals compete to release insta post before each other
1/1/23, 01:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂😂😂
1/1/23, 01:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ACE wants to meet you 😂
1/1/23, 01:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They did conduct some intro session for freshers
1/1/23, 01:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: funding issues had affected researches plus talent escapes to west, Russian university no more are among best physics institutes
1/1/23, 01:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's all I know and I'm someone who follows them on insta, actively 😂
1/1/23, 01:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What's the purpose of ACE btw? What is their motto? 😂
1/1/23, 01:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True true 🥲
1/1/23, 01:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: what makes you believe so, for god sake why can't you just accept what is being told without questioning 👀🤣
1/1/23, 01:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Questioning makes me human. Without that I'll be a scarecrow, worse than being a crow itself 😂
1/1/23, 01:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but i don't, i am not even a member of it
1/1/23, 01:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Join their creative team. You'll get work before every festival
1/1/23, 01:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: they mustn't, atleast some freshers will have chance to convert branch to better ones if they will waste time like this even their chances will fade
1/1/23, 01:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i don't actually, wild guess: to spread the message of their grate leader comrade BHawesh

1/2/23, 01:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: no difference, in the land of comrade we have 7 laws to implement what is said, the 7 laws has evolved a lot with the gradual maturing of our society in the guidance of our great leader comrade himself'

1/3/23, 18:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interesting
1/3/23, 18:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://youtu.be/ZUI78ecwMH4
1/3/23, 18:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But are the balls supplied by Pakistan used in the matches too or just for training?
1/3/23, 18:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They said they don't incorporate the tracking tech inside it
1/3/23, 18:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm too lazy to check other sources 🥲
1/3/23, 19:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Interesting manufacturing practices, too much emphasis on hygiene, all workers in hazmat suit 👀
1/3/23, 19:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: for matches also i guess
1/3/23, 19:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: the tracking device is incorporated by fifa ig they won't allow 3rd party to have access to ball position data as it can be capitalized
1/3/23, 19:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhhh
1/3/23, 19:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can't help imagine, do they rip the balls apart to insert the device and then stitch them up again?
1/3/23, 19:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: "The match balls are made in China. Adidas declined to identify the manufacturer."

1/3/23, 23:25 - Saamp🐍: It was good tbh 😌
1/3/23, 23:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm like an algorithm processing everything sequentially and bidirectionally
1/3/23, 23:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If the start of a word becomes difficult to read
1/3/23, 23:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I read from the end to help me guess what the word is
1/3/23, 23:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Even that fails and I read the other words and try to guess what the unknown word is
1/3/23, 23:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I forgot how the va in schwa is writtem
1/3/23, 23:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I had some doubts
1/3/23, 23:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But then shwasam is the only word that fit there
1/3/23, 23:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also I remembered how my friend named 'Swathi' wrote her name in Malayalam
1/3/23, 23:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So it made sense
1/3/23, 23:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: phonetics and language expert: Sneha ji

1/3/23, 23:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They don't add much meaning to the sentence
1/3/23, 23:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Although I think such things have already been done
1/3/23, 23:31 - Saamp🐍: If you forgot question mark then I'm fine... Otherwise Yes sir, I'm fine.
1/3/23, 23:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Perhaps looking at how someone like me does second language acquisition we can help models who struggle in the beginning
1/3/23, 23:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Training speed can be accelerated greatly
1/3/23, 23:31 - Saamp🐍: For languages like hindi gujarati sanskrit and Malayalam it'll be easy ig...

1/3/23, 23:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Use Chinese Fishing nets @919499725866 @919188011081 😂😂😂
1/3/23, 23:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but why can't i spread? george orwell is gem of a write, Hemingway is also good
1/3/23, 23:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You have telecommunication and media. Spare the fish 🥲
1/3/23, 23:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: way too many articles these days i see
1/3/23, 23:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't want to eat co**** fish
1/3/23, 23:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/3/23, 23:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/3/23, 23:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because co**** fish can be disastrous for us and themselves
1/3/23, 23:40 - Amritanshu Raj CR: not recommended as they might start revolution in stomach
1/3/23, 23:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nah, reading more news that's it 🥲
Father said he'll subscribe if I want but I said no. I read so many that the app doesn't even let me bookmark them anymore 🥲🥲🥲
1/3/23, 23:41 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/3/23, 23:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Although I don't eat them raw. Maybe an issue for people who do eat them raw
1/3/23, 23:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Stomach acid is too strong tbh
1/3/23, 23:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm glad I don't have gastric ulcers
1/3/23, 23:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Otherwise I would be flat on bed for the past one month
1/3/23, 23:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: subscribe then if like it then do it
1/3/23, 23:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have illeal ulcers and potential jejunal ulcers
1/3/23, 23:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Too expensive. My parents are broke after paying for my tests and treatment 🫠
1/3/23, 23:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They aren't broke, but I don't want to ask anything more 🫠
1/3/23, 23:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: the revolution will ripe then fast or it will be riped rev from beggining
1/3/23, 23:44 - Amritanshu Raj CR: haven't used college insurance?
1/3/23, 23:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I used my mother's insurance. They pay better. But more claims
1/3/23, 23:44 - Amritanshu Raj CR: when you will recover completely?
1/3/23, 23:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Too many talks of revolution. We need a revolution to push Shakti out
1/3/23, 23:45 - Amritanshu Raj CR: considerate i see
1/3/23, 23:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't know. Hopefully by March. That's a good estimate if nothing else happens in between

1/3/23, 23:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: LIC is cool. Good benefits. Currently my father is not under my mother's insurance. We've written many appeals for that. But there are issues because he has many other document related issues
1/3/23, 23:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/3/23, 23:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, but you have to mess food from mid jan you know right?
1/3/23, 23:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have other health issues, but they are not harmful and require lifestyle changes more than treatment. We've kept them aside. These are more important 🫠
1/3/23, 23:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup, I'll eat bread and butter
1/3/23, 23:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😶‍🌫
1/3/23, 23:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Yep, Lic has maximum penetration in the Indian market as it was only insurance company back in 90s

1/3/23, 23:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: abandon fast food, swadeshi apnaye
1/3/23, 23:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Morning I'll go to mess and eat breakfast and stuff my dabba with bread and butter
1/3/23, 23:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I never eat fast food, apart from mess food 🥲
1/3/23, 23:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The first time I ate pani puri was after coming here in mess
1/3/23, 23:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I never ate pav bhaji
1/3/23, 23:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Never ate pizza (want to try it someday)
1/3/23, 23:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ate 2 burgers in my life

1/3/23, 23:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I like what I eat
1/3/23, 23:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't get cravings for fast food
1/3/23, 23:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was to show that I ate this stuff a countable number of times 😂
1/3/23, 23:57 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that is antenna for mid air transmission

1/3/23, 23:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, good food i see
1/3/23, 23:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You need it more than me
1/3/23, 23:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: edit it with a filter and people may confuse you holding marigold.

That business they don't do there
1/4/23, 00:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: bad for economy
1/4/23, 00:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: nope, to contact atc else it may lose path
1/4/23, 00:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You're right it does look like a flower 😂
1/4/23, 00:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I'm not happy. i'm just fine
1/4/23, 00:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My peers make it up for me. Don't worry
1/4/23, 00:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ATC?
1/4/23, 00:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: as like 99.85% times

1/4/23, 00:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but the kimd above will need the atc
1/4/23, 00:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh. Give me the statistics for bird deaths due to flights 😶‍🌫
1/4/23, 00:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nah, the bird ans eagle are one

1/4/23, 00:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: don't know
1/4/23, 00:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sed lyf. This is one such instance of silence, is it?
1/4/23, 00:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Pro at diplomacy
1/4/23, 00:05 - Amritanshu Raj CR: given him either a space suit or a lota of water
1/4/23, 00:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: see i told ya
1/4/23, 00:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: bope pro at comedy
1/4/23, 00:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He doesn't need it. He is the little prince
1/4/23, 00:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Read "the little prince". Only 100 pages long. *It's not a kids book*
1/4/23, 00:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Neither is it morally preaching
1/4/23, 00:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It deals with some broad themes that kids realise only when they are older

1/4/23, 00:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😶‍🌫😶‍🌫😶‍🌫
1/4/23, 00:21 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you understand second ref right?
1/4/23, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not really. What is it? 🫠
1/4/23, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://youtu.be/SZorAJ4I-sA
1/4/23, 00:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: To whom it may concern:
Due to extreme winte i'm typing a bit wrong as am using one hand only
See in second it should have been winter
1/4/23, 00:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is an amazing video with a high level overview that anybody can understand. I've used Bert and T5 in a model and it's simply awesome
1/4/23, 00:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Is it snowing there?
1/4/23, 00:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: anybody part is bit sketchy i think,
*anybody from cs would be better
1/4/23, 00:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: not actually
1/4/23, 00:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ☹️☹️☹️
1/4/23, 00:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not really. It's understandable for anybody. Watch it and tell me 🥲
1/4/23, 00:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: lota is steel mug to be concise
1/4/23, 00:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂😂😂
1/4/23, 00:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: in ai you write models from 0 or import python library
1/4/23, 00:29 - Amritanshu Raj CR: ?
1/4/23, 00:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I read it as 'lots' giving you the freedom of typos since you're unable to type properly
1/4/23, 00:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Import of course. Researchers write it for us
1/4/23, 00:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We need to know about their existence and use them properly
1/4/23, 00:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: they explain the algo in class
1/4/23, 00:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: ?
1/4/23, 00:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: TAs?
1/4/23, 00:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And pre-processing is essential and crucial. I can't emphasize enough. If done properly you'll do great
1/4/23, 00:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohh, I thought you were talking about ML in general 🥲
1/4/23, 00:32 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, so you can develop some program that can predict stock prices ?
1/4/23, 00:32 - Amritanshu Raj CR: using previous prices
1/4/23, 00:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In AI class, we had to implement some very simple algorithms (including dfs, bfs, uniform cost search, beam search, A* search, etc
1/4/23, 00:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sir taught us the algos. Yup
1/4/23, 00:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No. These are standard stuff you can get them on the internet. I mid understood your question before
1/4/23, 00:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oo ok, preprocessing means like fitting them on some mathematical function?
1/4/23, 00:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup, definitely. You interested in inter IIT? 😂
1/4/23, 00:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yeah that only 🥲
1/4/23, 00:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No. It's looking at the data and changing and modifying it in ways that'll give us better results. Some types of models need specific kinds of data
1/4/23, 00:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🫠🫠🫠
1/4/23, 00:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oo i see, Ai and ml are different?
1/4/23, 00:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ~Data~
1/4/23, 00:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
Ignore what I said. I thought you were asking about our AI course 🥲🥲🥲
1/4/23, 00:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But yes, AI and ML are different. ML is a subset of AI
1/4/23, 00:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: nope, i don't think i have enough knowledge
1/4/23, 00:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You need to copy paste code from the internet and know what to use
1/4/23, 00:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oo, i see, this predicting part falls under ai or ml
1/4/23, 00:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/4/23, 00:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂😂😂
1/4/23, 00:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Prediction is a class of problems that we try to solve using various methods
1/4/23, 00:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They don't fall under any category
1/4/23, 00:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They are a problem as such. You can classify them based on hardness perhaps
1/4/23, 00:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: nakal k liye bhi akal chaiye 🥲, people are pro, one must accept limitations
1/4/23, 00:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup. I understand. You learn by doing 😂
1/4/23, 00:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: XG boost and LSTM are good methods for this I guess
1/4/23, 00:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I can't guarantee 🫠
1/4/23, 00:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was trying a competition on breast cancer detection using images. Lets say I'm failing miserably as of now 😂
1/4/23, 00:41 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oo ok, i see, so they are separate and what is use of probability and all those things in these
1/4/23, 00:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Concepts of probably are used everywhere 😂
1/4/23, 00:41 - Amritanshu Raj CR: oo, ok
1/4/23, 00:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sometimes doing the entire computation is not viable
1/4/23, 00:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Then you take the probability of something to reduce the cost of search. It saves a lot of time
1/4/23, 00:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's one application
1/4/23, 00:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There are many other applications based on your data
1/4/23, 00:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: how good are these, like can i use em to invest some money?
1/4/23, 00:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: level of trust?
1/4/23, 00:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Everything can be shifted to a normal distribution and used to estimate (MLE) and stuff..m
1/4/23, 00:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There are existing services which have perfected this art better than what you and I can write 🥲
1/4/23, 00:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: As for investing, looking at market risks and experience is a better option I feel 🥲
1/4/23, 00:44 - Amritanshu Raj CR: wow that's good, use mammography reports and identify patterns
1/4/23, 00:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They are trustworthy, but why risk your money on them right away. You are intellectual enough to be able to predict these things based on news and other sources
1/4/23, 00:46 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, i see
1/4/23, 00:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup. But it's very blotchy. The model is a terrible pathologist. I was annoying my doctor brother to help me identify pointers to look at 🫠
1/4/23, 00:46 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My father invests, he has a good friend who advises him. He uses no model 🥲
1/4/23, 00:47 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Although I'm that sort of person who would love to experiment with a model, I'd never recommend it to someone else 🫠
1/4/23, 00:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: there one can reach in few years of trading and changing algos?
1/4/23, 00:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: experience + observation?
1/4/23, 00:48 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but ai efficiency will keep increasing overtime?
1/4/23, 00:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Depends on your priorities. How much time can you spend on learning? Learning and improving is a life long process. And the question is if you should
1/4/23, 00:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes. But the market is very unpredictable
1/4/23, 00:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: not intellect , ai's are very good they can do almost everything a human can do even better, i have seen Chatgpt writes way too better things
1/4/23, 00:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you sharing your blurry vision issues with a blind person
1/4/23, 00:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Chatgpt is a transformer based model for text generation
1/4/23, 00:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: AI has capabilities
1/4/23, 00:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But with so much noise (so much probability) it's difficult
1/4/23, 00:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was trying to find an article, unable to find it 🥲
1/4/23, 00:52 - Amritanshu Raj CR: learning tech is always rewarding i have seen, irrespective of field using tech gives advantage
1/4/23, 00:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup. I agree to that
1/4/23, 00:53 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that's why an ai model can perform better,It can accommodate worst case scenarios which we may miss
1/4/23, 00:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: explain?
1/4/23, 00:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It doesn't usually do that 😂
1/4/23, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because of noise
1/4/23, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: AI works on data
1/4/23, 00:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If the data you give has few outliers (cases when something is amiss or is really bad about the market) it'll most likely ignore it
1/4/23, 00:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You can ask it to give more weights to those outliers
1/4/23, 00:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But then it'll become overly cautious, won't take risks
1/4/23, 00:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's a big issue with these algorithms
1/4/23, 00:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If you use deep kerning everything is even more of a muddle
1/4/23, 00:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Deep lerning is a black box, we don't know what the model is learning
1/4/23, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's learning something to be able to solve your problem of fit your data to it's categories. You often can't make sense of the weights
1/4/23, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 'Weights' used in neural networks
1/4/23, 00:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It just works. It's a black box
1/4/23, 01:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, now i see but every coming year they are releasing more capable ai's maybe 5 years from here we will have ai's capable of trading?
1/4/23, 01:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Shortest path computations and all those things have nothing to do with ai?
1/4/23, 01:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, you should compile these things at one place, explanation is very helpful
1/4/23, 01:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Perhaps...  There already are companies who have developed advanced algorithms to do stuff like that. Find out their success rate and do the research
1/4/23, 01:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They do. In fact in sem4 a lot of what we did was that 😂
1/4/23, 01:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There are different classes if problems and there are appropriate methods to solve them. You can't fit every problem into every method
1/4/23, 01:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Think of catalyst and substrate, but a bit more general
1/4/23, 01:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's there everywhere on the Internet 🥲
1/4/23, 01:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/buffetts-bet-hedge-funds-year-eight-brka-brkb.asp#:~:text=In%202008%2C%20Warren%20Buffett%20issued,Bloomberg%20op%2Ded%20in%20May.
1/4/23, 01:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, develop an ml model so capable that can develop a good trading algo
1/4/23, 01:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Read this. Now think of the hedge funds to be your ML model
1/4/23, 01:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, those things are pretty interesting
1/4/23, 01:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is an excellent example and will be applicable for years to come
1/4/23, 01:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: still, i doubt this simple approach to explain complex things would be there
1/4/23, 01:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: why don't you try for inter-iit
1/4/23, 01:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: let me read
1/4/23, 01:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Good question. I don't know if that problem is P or NP in CS terms 😂
Basically I'm not sure, but just to know, every problem is not solvable and even if they are solvable they may not be solvable in polynomial time (in short computation may not be complete before you die)
1/4/23, 01:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It'll be there somewhere. After all I too learnt it 😂
1/4/23, 01:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Good question. I want to, but how. They don't seem to be taking members by an open process. I don't want to comment much on that. I didn't apply before because I wasn't sure
1/4/23, 01:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, so computational limit is hampering Ai right
1/4/23, 01:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's always an issue: time and resources. Improving hardware is not possible beyond a limit
1/4/23, 01:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But it's just not the computational complexity. Some problems are just not solvable
1/4/23, 01:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/4/23, 01:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Damn, I've never referred to so many CS concepts in a conversation before 😂
1/4/23, 01:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's more math. Gödel's incompleteness theorem
1/4/23, 01:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: just pkd things 🥲, you know tech sec in person?

1/4/23, 01:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There will be things which cannot be proven
1/4/23, 01:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: maybe the cs students need a revolutionary leader like comrade napoleon to lead them to triumph on such problems
1/4/23, 01:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes in a way, but I abandoned the astronomy club remember? 😂
1/4/23, 01:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>

1/4/23, 01:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There are other problem statements yet to be released. Not necessary that I have to work on the high prep ones 🥲
1/4/23, 01:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: obviously, but this stuff can be used to write pessimistic essays 👀
1/4/23, 01:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also I don't have a lot of energy. Not committing to anything this week. Next week I'll be running to the hospital again
1/4/23, 01:24 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i understand how cs people do good in these things but how ee people do good in ai-ml?
1/4/23, 01:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://youtu.be/EHp4FPyajKQ
Nice video. Big problem in CS
1/4/23, 01:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: meaning of life i see
1/4/23, 01:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't be too optimistic about that. If someone with the proper knowledge finds you oversimplifying stuff they'll be upset 😂
You'll become a meme
1/4/23, 01:26 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/4/23, 01:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because they have to learn about a lot of this stuff too, ideally...
1/4/23, 01:27 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yeah ok noice, i see you can do good in these (AI-ML thing)
1/4/23, 01:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They have some stuff in their syllabus. I don't know for sure. Otherwise they learn it from elsewhere for more opportunities. They have the incentive to learn too
1/4/23, 01:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: take care only your health is holding you back, break the shackles of slavery be healthy again
1/4/23, 01:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can I guess. But many can 🫠

1/4/23, 01:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: thing is generally i don't write pessimistic

1/4/23, 01:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm doing. Time is a big issue. These models take a lot of time to train. I wrote in the morning and train a bunch of stuff at night 🥲
1/4/23, 01:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: demm, training depends on net speed?
1/4/23, 01:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Didn't really get how the expression was formulated 😂
1/4/23, 01:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Comrade has a message for you. Overthrow Shakti kitchen
1/4/23, 01:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you understand what the result it is implying?
1/4/23, 01:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not net speed. CPU speed (if you're doing it locally) net speed if you're using google colab

1/4/23, 01:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: just add top 5

1/5/23, 00:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have 100s of old diaries. But they don't smell nice anymore. I can go to book shops and smell books 🫠
Last day I went to H&C (a very popular book store in Kerala) to buy a stapler. I stood there for 20 min window shopping and basking in the fragrance of new books
1/5/23, 00:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Projects

1/5/23, 14:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Moreover you're trying to imply that bribing is an easy route to survive in your comrade's society. So your comrade couldn't evict society of evil?

1/6/23, 19:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why force students to do religious things 🥲
1/6/23, 19:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: It didn't matter much but I did feel like it was going against my freedom of religion
1/6/23, 19:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: But meh
1/6/23, 19:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I would feel the same tbh
1/6/23, 19:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: No classes
1/6/23, 19:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In my school all the prayers are Hindu prayers
1/6/23, 19:35 - Lekshmi R Nair: Was a win
1/6/23, 19:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't know how I'd feel about that
1/6/23, 19:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But it wasn't compulsory to recite the prayer
1/6/23, 19:36 - Lekshmi R Nair: That's also not completely fine ryt? In my school all religions had to go for Gita class
1/6/23, 19:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't even have to hold your hands together, recite or close your eyes
1/6/23, 19:36 - Lekshmi R Nair: To be fair 99m9% were hindus
1/6/23, 19:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It isn't
1/6/23, 19:36 - Lekshmi R Nair: I think they would have made exceptions for Christians or muslims
1/6/23, 19:36 - Lekshmi R Nair: Dunno
1/6/23, 19:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh. We Sanskrit students were taught to recite Gita, because it was good practice
1/6/23, 19:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The teachers don't seem to have ulterior motives
1/6/23, 19:37 - Lekshmi R Nair: Oooo
1/6/23, 19:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And no Christian students took Sanskrit
1/6/23, 19:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: this is blasphemy, comrade's character is being deliberately assassinated
1/6/23, 19:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not a single one
1/6/23, 19:37 - Lekshmi R Nair: As far as I have seen, Hindus aren't that keen on converting
1/6/23, 19:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They should have made it optional
1/6/23, 19:37 - Lekshmi R Nair: Atleast in Kerala

1/6/23, 19:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yeah, that was a subject

1/6/23, 19:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: She would explain it too
1/6/23, 19:39 - Lekshmi R Nair: We had to write 2 verses of Gita for it too
1/6/23, 19:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But it shouldn't have been forced
1/6/23, 19:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I enjoyed it
1/6/23, 19:39 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yed
1/6/23, 19:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh

1/7/23, 15:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nah, you already proposed to me. That's more than enough 😂
1/7/23, 15:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup. I'll argue is my hair is already short. It's just a little longer than shoulder length 😂

1/7/23, 15:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My father won't let me go to the chicken section
1/7/23, 15:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True true
1/7/23, 15:53 - Amritanshu Raj CR: They are pretty big I see, catch one alive for aquarium
1/7/23, 15:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/7/23, 15:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Only dead fish sold here
1/7/23, 15:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I'm octopus, it can see only 33% of it 👀
1/7/23, 15:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In Assam we buy live fish and store them in a bucket
1/7/23, 15:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And kill them before cooking
1/7/23, 15:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Pretty sad. I remember the fish looking at me
1/7/23, 15:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It touched my heart

1/7/23, 15:57 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Pretty much same here, back in the day I got some for a big tank we had, but often they died 🥲
1/7/23, 15:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Live fish. Not for food
1/7/23, 15:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhhh
1/7/23, 15:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Taking care of fish is a huge deal
1/7/23, 15:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They're delicate pets
1/7/23, 15:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: When you transfer them from tank to tank, that's a crucial process
1/7/23, 15:58 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Good as french fries alternative I say 👀
1/7/23, 15:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They may die if you make it abrupt
1/7/23, 15:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/7/23, 15:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: get one for your room here at college 👀
1/7/23, 15:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: at least you would bond better with the cat then
1/7/23, 15:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: I have gward that this is fish cruelty
1/7/23, 15:59 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I eventually learnt
1/7/23, 15:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: heard
1/7/23, 16:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: They weren't excalty pets,  mostly they were wild I got from some local fisherman
1/7/23, 16:01 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Parents never approved it
1/7/23, 16:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: They were transferred from pond to tank and that was not an aquarium
1/7/23, 16:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/7/23, 16:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/7/23, 16:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: They should have told me before
1/7/23, 16:04 - Amritanshu Raj CR: This is very shadowy subject, eating isn't cruelty 👀
1/7/23, 16:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂
1/7/23, 16:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: Nah nah. J meant without filters it's like dirty water for fish, small space and all
1/7/23, 16:06 - Lekshmi R Nair: I don't claim that I am taking care of fish by putting it in my mouth
1/7/23, 16:07 - Lekshmi R Nair: But they are by putting it in a brightly lit jar with colored pebbles
1/7/23, 16:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nope. I can't take care of it
1/7/23, 16:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Obviously it is, fishes aren't domesticated, the environment in which we keep them is no where near natural habitat but this concern mustn't be raised by peta like organisation's which promote milk free festives but keep mum on mass slaughtering of animals
1/7/23, 16:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yes I agree
1/7/23, 16:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If a pet dies in my care I won't be able to forgive myself
1/7/23, 16:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Cat can bond with milk too
1/7/23, 16:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup, it is. They don't live long
1/7/23, 16:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh, then definitely not in a tank at home 🥲
1/7/23, 16:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: By putting it in muth you can take care of yourself 🤣
1/7/23, 16:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: Peta is hypocrite
1/7/23, 16:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: A pond is a natural ecosystem
1/7/23, 16:12 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂
1/7/23, 16:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Replicating it requires a lot of effort
1/7/23, 16:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: They tried killing dogs in America uk
1/7/23, 16:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: Stealing pets
1/7/23, 16:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Most of them get affected by light pollution
1/7/23, 16:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: And sending them to be killed
1/7/23, 16:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
1/7/23, 16:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I guessed 😂
1/7/23, 16:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Often you learn it the hard way 🥲
1/7/23, 16:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/7/23, 16:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: ++
1/7/23, 16:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: I again wanted to clarify. Shit Pita pulls like the ignoring of slaughter of lambs while diwali causes issue is wrong. I just pointed out that when we have a pet, we also claim to be taking care of it, but what we are doing, is nit that, and such an industry shouldn't profit, especially when the living situation for aesthetics is made a hell...
1/7/23, 16:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: It can be comparable to white people who claim to be different,  going to African nations, giving them free shut that destroys their economy more...

Ig that exactly doesn't match
1/7/23, 16:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
1/7/23, 16:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yess
1/7/23, 16:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i understand your point and agree with your concern. The mockery of species can't be the base of a business, but like if you see japanese koi fish and all they live good life and is part of culture and to some extent we must accept their cultural practices but not the exotic species business
1/7/23, 16:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: in belgium they displayed black kids from africa in zoos in 1930s 🥲
1/7/23, 16:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/16/belgium-comes-to-terms-with-human-zoos-of-its-colonial-past
1/7/23, 16:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yes I agree
1/7/23, 16:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
1/7/23, 16:25 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i call it absolute woke madness, i say embrace liberalism but avoid wokeism
1/7/23, 16:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Whattt
1/7/23, 16:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's so messed up
1/7/23, 16:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/7/23, 16:27 - Lekshmi R Nair: When does the barriers cross. Like u get it when it goes bat shit crazy,  but there might be normal sounding stuff in between
1/7/23, 16:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Good point
1/7/23, 16:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Conflicts 🫠
1/7/23, 16:28 - Amritanshu Raj CR: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/29/arts/design/human-zoos-africa-museum.html
1/7/23, 16:28 - Lekshmi R Nair: A lot of countries owe up to their colonial past. While I understand that currebt generation is not to blame for colonization,  an apology and acknowledgement is always nice.
It will also serve as a reminder.

Responsible countries do it... Unlike Britian cough cough
1/7/23, 16:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: western idea of human rights is more about interests than real human rights, when west questions humans rights i see hypocrisy of high level but also we must not abandon the idea of human rights.
1/7/23, 16:32 - Amritanshu Raj CR: draw a line b/w interests, rationality and own liberalism
1/7/23, 16:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: for eg. the question of illegal migrants, west doesn't want illegal migrants in their countries but question India when it does so in case of Rohengia's etc
1/7/23, 16:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: nothing has changed, you can see the difference in the treatment of refugees from ukraine and middle east, even though in middle east it is west who messed up
1/7/23, 16:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: nationalism is also imp, but i count it in interests
1/7/23, 16:36 - Lekshmi R Nair: I saw. I wondered why. Then I remembered.  Ignorance is awesome. So... me not getting fired up
1/7/23, 16:36 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😌
1/7/23, 16:36 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ukraine gets a lot more kindness
1/7/23, 16:37 - Lekshmi R Nair: Rohengyas were causing issues in Bangladesh I heard
1/7/23, 16:37 - Lekshmi R Nair: Dunno what to think
1/7/23, 17:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/7/23, 17:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: question on accepting refugees: should they try to adopt the culture of their host country or try to modify the laws there to suit themselves? 
It should be somewhere in between. But what if this leads to violence? When they don't want to adopt the rules and culture of their host?
1/7/23, 17:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://youtu.be/oKY600o3CXw
1/7/23, 17:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I remember watching this a long time back

1/7/23, 17:40 - Saamp🐍: That's .....
1/7/23, 17:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: A viable strategy for me

1/7/23, 17:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There is this train called venad
1/7/23, 17:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 3 years back they revamped the train
1/7/23, 17:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And now second class is chair car
1/7/23, 17:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They did it to accommodate more people I guess
1/7/23, 17:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because train runs at office time and gets very crowded
1/7/23, 17:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But thr seats are so small. It's so uncomfortable. Worse than airplane seats
1/7/23, 17:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And you have these big men and women (I'm a big person myself) and they squash me
1/7/23, 17:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲
1/7/23, 17:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Even if I get a seat I'm reluctant to sit as I get squished into pulp anyway 🥲
1/7/23, 17:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have started to hate that train
1/7/23, 17:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Today I fell down in metro, when it hit thr brakes suddenly and I was standing with luggage in my hands
1/7/23, 17:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My father thought that I fainted
1/7/23, 17:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>

1/7/23, 18:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Today the first metro I got into was named Mandakini
1/7/23, 18:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Currently I'm in a menu
1/7/23, 18:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You know what, they've equalized fares of all trains in Kerala
1/7/23, 18:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have to pay ₹30 instead of ₹10 on a normal unreserved train now
1/7/23, 18:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My father is pretty upset
1/7/23, 18:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He says we'll get a season ticket next time because otherwise it's a loss for us
1/7/23, 18:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Usually we ho by train 3/7 days of the week 🥲
1/7/23, 18:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We usually return by venad too
1/7/23, 18:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's so crowded
1/7/23, 18:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You can't even stand on tiptoe
1/7/23, 18:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's worse than how I stood in the return bus on Diwali day
1/7/23, 18:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: For 30 min that day I was thinking I should have stayed there that night
1/7/23, 18:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Even @919499725866 was there beside me 🥲
1/7/23, 18:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Today we are returning by the next train
1/7/23, 18:19 - Saamp🐍: 🥲🥲🥲
1/7/23, 18:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Why did you get into that bus that day?

1/7/23, 18:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: When I returned I couldn't find anything

1/7/23, 18:22 - Saamp🐍: Why was your things in haripriyas room
1/7/23, 18:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Thank god I changed my clothes
1/7/23, 18:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Otherwise my nice dress would have been ruined
1/7/23, 18:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because I stayed in her room since morning
1/7/23, 18:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I went there early in the morning
1/7/23, 18:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: For inner peace
1/7/23, 18:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Many things were happening in my room for the last few days and I wanted a break 😂
1/7/23, 18:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was finding reasons to escape
1/7/23, 18:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Then I thought I'll go early

1/9/23, 15:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Shiva shivaa
1/9/23, 15:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is what I do when I've run out of space in my suitcase, sit on it
1/9/23, 15:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've never heard people make this mistake before 😂 perhaps podi isn't popular enough 🤔
1/9/23, 15:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh, where?
1/9/23, 15:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nooo 😂
How are cows transported though? I've seen pigs being transported. But it looks like an open goods train carriage with railings instead of normal walls
1/9/23, 15:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's neither. Can't be second as it doesn't have arms
1/9/23, 15:34 - Lekshmi R Nair: Copycat
1/9/23, 15:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's actually a dynamic track stabilizer 
I had only read about them until today. First time seeing it
1/9/23, 15:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You'll never hear him come this close to saying something like podi in real life
1/9/23, 15:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Relish the moment 😂

1/9/23, 19:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This machine is a DGS. It's written on it too. Pretty interesting... Don't know why did they station it here
1/9/23, 19:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: search DRM in railway

1/9/23, 19:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Very complex for my little brain
1/9/23, 19:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I need deconstruction
1/9/23, 19:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You gave enough context for it to be assumed as the non masala podi. Whenever you say masala podi you need proper context, at a restaurant etc. But the other podi can be used anywhere and will implicitly mean so unless some other context is specified
1/9/23, 19:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Since this is getting a lot of attention I wanted to bring this up
1/9/23, 19:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Future and past Linguistics students listen closely
1/9/23, 19:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Malayalam is one of those languages that doesn't delete schwa
1/9/23, 19:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It has a schwa at the end of every word, almost. I don't know Malayalam that well to give absolute statements
1/9/23, 19:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Languages like Hindi delete schwa
1/9/23, 19:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Hindi doesn't have schwa. Because of which it has sharper endings
1/9/23, 19:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sanskrit retains it's schwa
1/9/23, 19:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Just compare how 'shiv' is pronounced in Hindi Malayalam and Sanskrit
1/9/23, 19:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is actually very interesting and there is a lot going on
1/9/23, 19:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Most (if not all) of the participants in valorant are men 🤔
1/9/23, 19:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But I would really like to know. Are there any reasons for the creative disparity?

1/9/23, 22:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Cute
1/9/23, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We all know why 👀
1/9/23, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents still call Krishan as Krishnan
1/9/23, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🫠
1/9/23, 22:21 - Lekshmi R Nair: Mine too
1/9/23, 22:21 - Lekshmi R Nair: 😂
1/9/23, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ummm, no
1/9/23, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
1/9/23, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've corrected them so many times
1/9/23, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The best it'll get to is Krishna
1/9/23, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Swapped a and n
1/9/23, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Better than Krishnan
1/9/23, 22:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Initially my mother called Siddhu, Sadhu
1/9/23, 22:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The latter means a sage or rishi in Bangla
1/9/23, 22:26 - Lekshmi R Nair: In every language
1/9/23, 22:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nicee
1/9/23, 22:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But pronunciation is different in bangla
1/9/23, 22:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/9/23, 22:30 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
1/9/23, 22:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I know
1/9/23, 22:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There is no s in bangla
1/9/23, 22:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: occasion/festive ?
1/9/23, 22:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: S is a fricative
1/9/23, 22:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No fricatives
1/9/23, 22:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Too sharp, too harsh
1/9/23, 22:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Do Dirichlet smoothening but applied to language
1/9/23, 22:32 - Amritanshu Raj CR: only mech lab have some machinery on that scale ig
1/9/23, 22:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup I want big machines
1/9/23, 22:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Things at least the size of the lathe machine rooms
1/9/23, 22:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲
1/9/23, 22:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not the machine, but the room itself
1/9/23, 22:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🤧
1/9/23, 22:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: civil lab have a crane 👀
1/9/23, 22:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 3-d printer
1/9/23, 22:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: and a little terrified too i must say
1/9/23, 22:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://m.indiamart.com/impcat/paper-machinery.html
1/9/23, 22:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Something like this. But this is too small and cheap. Low capacity.
1/9/23, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And it's just the recycling part I guess
1/9/23, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh, that sounds interesting. But will they let us enter? I wonder 😂
1/9/23, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Biju Sir rules our comp lab
1/9/23, 22:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because of him I'm terrified to even drink water
1/9/23, 22:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I take my bottle outside the lab and drink water and then re enter
1/9/23, 22:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He has his reasons, but..m
1/9/23, 22:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 3D printer is that big?
1/9/23, 22:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: should we hire a tank for you?👀
1/9/23, 22:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Emjoy life. Don't succumb to fear 😌
1/9/23, 22:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: lathe is in ahailya 🥲
1/9/23, 22:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I won't pay though. You can, I invite you
1/9/23, 22:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yeah, but that's not open 🥲
1/9/23, 22:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: civil yard (one with crane is big) but it is way too messy, too little space and way too many equipments, cement, molds etc.....
1/9/23, 22:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh, then I definitely want to go
1/9/23, 22:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And see the equipment
1/9/23, 22:39 - Amritanshu Raj CR: 19 crore is cheap?
1/9/23, 22:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I really want to
1/9/23, 22:39 - Sneha Doubt Solver: For a heavy industry it is
1/9/23, 22:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The one here must be around 70crore decades ago
1/9/23, 22:40 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i highly doubt petrichor will include civil lab in its plan
1/9/23, 22:40 - Amritanshu Raj CR: not in the nights
1/9/23, 22:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't want to take my father there. That they definitely won't let...
I want to see them myself 🥲
1/9/23, 22:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't go there at night 🥲
1/9/23, 22:41 - Amritanshu Raj CR: not even be this much scared, keep bottle below but you can drink, i have done it many times
1/9/23, 22:42 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Once Kavya was munching on something in the lab. She was sitting just next to me
1/9/23, 22:42 - Amritanshu Raj CR: sed life

1/9/23, 22:44 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/9/23, 22:45 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you can come anyday (mon-friday), you won't face any issue
1/9/23, 22:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This will be helpful too. I can store some good water from innovation lab in my room. Won't have to go again and again. Please arrange one for me
1/9/23, 22:45 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can just enter the lab?
1/9/23, 22:46 - Amritanshu Raj CR: trust me it is not even that interesting, but we had a hand cart in civil lab on which we tried skateboarding that is really interesting

1/9/23, 22:50 - Amritanshu Raj CR: but weight, who will carry it
1/9/23, 22:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep, but better if you go with civil people
1/9/23, 22:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Niceee. That sounds fun 😂
1/9/23, 22:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Now the machines are in urgent need of repair. Few days back they tried to run another segment called the recovery boiler
1/9/23, 22:53 - Sneha Doubt Solver: One person asked my father if they should. He said not without repairs. But they may try at 20% capacity. They are running it at 33% capacity now and my father discussed this with some old engineers and concluded that there will be a huge explosion if they move to full capacity. We'll be in the news, for the wrong reasons
1/9/23, 22:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My roommate does that a lot. You know she got so used to it that she was eating lays from her bag while sitting in the room 😂

1/10/23, 10:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Does anyone know the professor for nanobio?
1/10/23, 10:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Has he ever taken a course for anyone? Or mech students?
1/10/23, 10:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: *bargaining
1/10/23, 11:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes, which is why, in addition to listing the prerequisite course, we have mentioned that
consent of the teacher is necessary; this is, mainly, to regulate the number. Taking the capacity of
the current facilities into consideration, we would not want more than 10 students (definitely not
more than 15). In a given lab space (say, the cleanroom), we would not want more than 5 souls at
any given time.

I like how she used the word souls
1/10/23, 11:17 - Saamp🐍: Which course?
1/10/23, 11:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nanoelectric lab
1/10/23, 11:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Now I really want to experience the clean room and wear that suit
1/10/23, 11:20 - Saamp🐍: That's a course?
1/10/23, 11:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: PME for electrical
1/10/23, 11:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I just checked the syllabus
1/10/23, 11:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm still GCE hunting 🥲
1/10/23, 11:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not sure what to do 😭
1/10/23, 11:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: U have to take theory to take the lab
1/10/23, 11:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
1/10/23, 11:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: Not just lab
1/10/23, 11:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't want it
1/10/23, 11:49 - Lekshmi R Nair: So it's basically like an entire huge course
1/10/23, 11:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I was just looking
1/10/23, 11:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not of any use to me
1/10/23, 11:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I want nice GCE 🥲
1/10/23, 11:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Can't find any 😭
1/10/23, 11:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Electro chemistry and corrosion syllabus is basically same as JEE syllabus
1/10/23, 11:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But it's in Nila
1/10/23, 11:51 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ee People have all classes in Nila
1/10/23, 11:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ehhh

1/10/23, 11:55 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
1/10/23, 11:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I thought they'll be shifting EE to Nila completely after looking at the time table

1/10/23, 11:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: All their electives are in Ahalia
1/10/23, 11:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is madness
1/10/23, 11:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How many times are they supposed to travel in a day
1/10/23, 11:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's a pure waste of precious time in commute
1/10/23, 11:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yes
1/10/23, 11:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is unacceptable
1/10/23, 11:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: And we don't see any actual progress in situation
1/10/23, 11:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: Institute point blank refuses to give a shit
1/10/23, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: How is the situation for 2nd year electrical
1/10/23, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: Thus was known a month ago
1/10/23, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: I heard it them
1/10/23, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: Then
1/10/23, 12:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ahalia only
1/10/23, 12:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Lab in Nila
1/10/23, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: Then y 3rd year

1/10/23, 12:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: Are they high or something
1/10/23, 12:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And electrical machines partially
1/10/23, 12:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's in both Nila and Ahalia
1/10/23, 12:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: These people are so shitty at planning
1/10/23, 12:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
1/10/23, 12:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am glad they didn't take ee away, but that's selfish on my part
1/10/23, 12:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They must have taken all banned substances together as a concoction
1/10/23, 12:02 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲🥲
1/10/23, 12:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Even then situation is equally bad
1/10/23, 12:02 - Lekshmi R Nair: They are losing shit ton of time
1/10/23, 12:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They have to come to Ahalia for every PME
1/10/23, 12:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And for people who want Honors
1/10/23, 12:02 - Lekshmi R Nair: And gce ig
1/10/23, 12:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's like 6 classes per week for pmes
1/10/23, 12:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yeah...

1/10/23, 12:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: One of my friends is considering a NPTEL GCE too. But I'm still wary about it
1/10/23, 13:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Prime reason being laziness and more work load
1/10/23, 13:05 - Lekshmi R Nair: Why does our 3 credit courses have 4 classes per week?
1/10/23, 13:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I wondered too
1/10/23, 13:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I hope they get rid of the 8AM class
1/10/23, 13:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My brain doesn't function at 8 in the morning

1/10/23, 22:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My fathers house in Assam has many back doors
1/10/23, 22:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 3 I guess
1/10/23, 22:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We lock all of them at night, with huge locks
1/10/23, 22:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: Oooo
1/10/23, 22:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: We also do
1/10/23, 22:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Toilet is outside 🥲
1/10/23, 22:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: Multiple layers of security
1/10/23, 22:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ooo. Shit
1/10/23, 22:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There is one toilet inside
1/10/23, 22:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But it's the poop toilet
1/10/23, 22:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
1/10/23, 22:50 - Lekshmi R Nair: Eh
1/10/23, 22:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The pee toilet is outside
1/10/23, 22:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Although nobody stops you from peeing in the poop toilet
1/10/23, 22:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But you can't poop in the pee toilet
1/10/23, 22:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup
1/10/23, 22:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/10/23, 22:51 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was very confusing to me as well
1/10/23, 22:52 - Lekshmi R Nair: Why can't u poop in pee toilet and vice versa?
1/10/23, 22:52 - Lekshmi R Nair: And isn't peeing more imp
1/10/23, 22:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: Poop u can deliberate and go
1/10/23, 22:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: Peeing is like
1/10/23, 22:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: U have to
1/10/23, 22:53 - Lekshmi R Nair: Tf is happening here
1/10/23, 22:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Pee toilet is an outlet kind of thing. You can't poop there. The passage isn't made for pooping
1/10/23, 22:54 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But you can pee in the poop toilet. It is more recently made and has proper drainage
1/10/23, 22:55 - Lekshmi R Nair: Just call it toilet then?
1/10/23, 22:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: One poop toilet is inside the house
1/10/23, 22:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I guess so. But everyone except for me follows the order
1/10/23, 22:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: With so many people in the house you need more toilets in the morning sometimes, at least for peeing 🥲
1/10/23, 22:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: True
1/10/23, 22:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Fun fact. You get to know who goes to poop and who goes to pee
1/10/23, 22:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
1/10/23, 22:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/10/23, 22:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm the only person who uses only the poop toilet because it has less mosquitoes
1/10/23, 22:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲
1/10/23, 22:57 - Lekshmi R Nair: Mosquitoes does sound uncomfortable
1/10/23, 22:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It is 🥲
1/10/23, 22:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: There is a huge drain outside
1/10/23, 22:58 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In fact the place is named after a drain
1/10/23, 22:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And it's an open drain. So you can imagine how bad it is
1/10/23, 22:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥲🥲🥲
1/10/23, 23:00 - Lekshmi R Nair: I like Kerala
1/10/23, 23:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: A lot of houses don't have proper sewage systems
1/10/23, 23:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And they don't have back valves protecting their pipes
1/10/23, 23:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In fact they don't have pipes
1/10/23, 23:00 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They just dump waste and sewage directly outside into the drain via channels
1/10/23, 23:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
1/10/23, 23:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So when it floods...
And no back valves....
1/10/23, 23:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You can imagine the situation
1/10/23, 23:01 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
1/10/23, 23:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's why there is a poop toilet and a pee toilet
1/10/23, 23:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Although I must say new houses don't have this issue
1/10/23, 23:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Our place is very very old
1/10/23, 23:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And we repaired everything to have proper drainage and a sewage system
1/10/23, 23:45 - Lekshmi R Nair: Nice njce

1/12/23, 22:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: sometimes life is like that only
1/12/23, 22:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Good point. Father didn't let me book because he wants to drop me. Otherwise I'll get excuse that I have a seat and he needn't come
1/12/23, 22:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My roommate will worry for me. Im worrying for the person I'm referring to
1/12/23, 22:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So the next best thing is to stand all the way to palakkad 😌
1/12/23, 22:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Btw @919188011081 paluravi has this sleeper ticket
1/12/23, 22:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: ?
1/12/23, 22:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: People without reservation can enter sleeper with this
1/12/23, 22:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's how so many people get into sleeper and occupy your seat too
1/12/23, 22:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ooooo... I thought it was RAC
1/12/23, 22:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: 🥺🥲
1/12/23, 22:20 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's almost as costly as a regular reservation ticket
1/12/23, 22:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: I had to be rude to random strangers
1/12/23, 22:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: That's y I like upper berth
1/12/23, 22:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 145 with reservation

1/12/23, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And some are with general ticket
1/12/23, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The second class coaches are so crowded the TTE doesn't have the heart to tell them to go
1/12/23, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Also one more thing
1/12/23, 22:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Kerala gov has introduced punching in their attendance, or so I heard
1/12/23, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So now people take Paluravi
1/12/23, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The next train Venad always reaches just before 10 or sometimes after
1/12/23, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So they'll be marked absent
1/12/23, 22:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So many people have shifted to Paluravi instead of Venad
1/12/23, 22:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Paluravi is usually madness these days, quoting the words of my mother
1/12/23, 22:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: On workdays especially. Don't know how it translates on a weekend
1/12/23, 22:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Although some people have stuck to venad
1/12/23, 22:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But the problem is they try to get out all at the same time
1/12/23, 22:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Everyone will get off at Ekm, but who will get down first?
1/12/23, 22:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's almost a stampede

1/26/23, 16:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Think of it as a first name and second name
1/26/23, 16:32 - Amritanshu Raj CR: We used to put books and copies, pens, pencils too for blessing
1/26/23, 16:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents are the only ones who call me sona and all other relatives call me sonamoni
1/26/23, 16:32 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I see

1/26/23, 16:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Same thing goes with other siblings. They have a first name and second name and only their parents use the first name only and everyone else uses both names together, mostly
1/26/23, 16:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They're awesome. But don't earn enough 🥲
1/26/23, 16:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Ok ok I see

1/27/23, 18:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm hungry
1/27/23, 18:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I don't want dinner 🥲
1/27/23, 18:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: because it is manufactured in my body(spleen), donated by me and will have atleast something that will have my DNA

1/27/23, 18:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/27/23, 18:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Spleen is the blood bank. It doesn't produce blood
1/27/23, 18:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It stores blood. Blood is manufactured in your bone marrow
1/27/23, 18:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Indeed, some countries have this system where they are informed if their blood is used. Imo it's encouraging
1/27/23, 19:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sushabhan Sir standing there for the QnA was the epitome of my life science experience. The way both of them talked clearly showed the difference between a great science communicator
1/27/23, 19:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And who is not one... 😶‍🌫

1/27/23, 19:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How did this come all of a sudden? 😂
1/27/23, 19:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: @919188011081

1/27/23, 19:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: khana khaye, dimaag nhi
1/27/23, 19:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But then saw he was in shorts
1/27/23, 19:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>

1/27/23, 19:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/27/23, 19:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Piyush Sir validates my actions of not dressing appropriately for class
1/27/23, 19:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I remember this exam when he and Anoop Sir were invigilating
1/27/23, 19:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: The stark difference
1/27/23, 19:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: Tf
1/27/23, 19:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: One in formals and polished shoes and other in Tee and shorts
1/27/23, 19:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: in our country they use blood from blood bank in bolloywood scenes so can't inform the user
1/27/23, 19:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Hey, nice kurta though
1/27/23, 19:13 - Lekshmi R Nair: Shorts and Kurta?
1/27/23, 19:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: When did I lie? I rarely lie
1/27/23, 19:14 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
1/27/23, 19:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/27/23, 19:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i agree

1/27/23, 19:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: no one died, i can confirm
1/27/23, 19:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: really? I thought that's fake blood or animal blood
1/27/23, 19:15 - Sneha Doubt Solver: How's that related ? 😂
1/27/23, 19:15 - Amritanshu Raj CR: bengalis have a thing for noble prizes, though today's speaker wasn't bengali
1/27/23, 19:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/27/23, 19:16 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Because I was wearing a kurti with not full pants and it seemed weird 😂
1/27/23, 19:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: joke but considering the thoughtfulness of our guys it would have definitely happened sometime
1/27/23, 19:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I confirm too. They were on a cliff, but didn't fall into the canyon
1/27/23, 19:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: matter closed
1/27/23, 19:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm an imposter. Also can't even read Tagore's works. I need my parents to sit and explain them to me line by line
1/27/23, 19:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I saw you today... You're on earth
1/27/23, 19:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲

1/27/23, 19:21 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
1/27/23, 19:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We need huge developments in the research space in India in terms of funding, infrastructure and collaborative work
1/27/23, 19:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's very difficult to pursue your research here
1/27/23, 19:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And gather funds large enough
1/27/23, 19:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: this is so true except i don't work in grps
1/27/23, 19:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Sometimes the equipment itself is so expensive the research will never get approved
1/27/23, 19:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
1/27/23, 19:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My family would prefer to burn me 🫠

1/27/23, 19:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You're a civil engineer?
1/27/23, 19:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Can you build a bridge alone?
1/27/23, 19:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Mobilize people for a common cause. I see the potential in you
1/27/23, 19:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: English doesn't give that feel
1/27/23, 19:32 - Amritanshu Raj CR: that was my clone

1/27/23, 19:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: like somereading reading in bengali and explaining in inglis
1/27/23, 19:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: All English translations capture the meaning for sure, but rarely the style
1/27/23, 19:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: nhi possible hai
1/27/23, 19:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: agree
1/27/23, 19:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: india is good for trials bad for research
1/27/23, 19:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: agree
1/27/23, 19:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I can't understand their HiFi Bangla. I have the vocab of a 7 year old
1/27/23, 19:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: they limit research ideas based on these factors
1/27/23, 19:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Omk, will try
1/27/23, 19:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/27/23, 19:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: it is not a great thing

1/27/23, 19:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's a huge barrier between us and progress
1/27/23, 19:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It is. When a bridge collapses people die
1/27/23, 19:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: yep, i see you wanna launch war on our neighbours, last time someone used these words 7 million jews were wiped off
1/27/23, 19:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: *people
1/27/23, 19:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/27/23, 19:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i cloned him to be non-bald

1/27/23, 19:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I would someday like to see you bald. I was low key hoping you'd be bald today 😂
1/27/23, 19:40 - Amritanshu Raj CR: learning bangla is only option, will be surprise for you family too
1/27/23, 19:40 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/27/23, 19:41 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i agree, what india can try is reverse engineering and later move to original research, we did in medicines, china did in engineering and manufacturing
1/27/23, 19:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
The problem is I don't want to learn from scratch. I want to learn Bangla such that it preserves my heritage and culture and respects the communities I belong to. Resources which satisfy these criteria are tough to find
1/27/23, 19:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
1/27/23, 19:43 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Interesting
1/27/23, 19:45 - Amritanshu Raj CR: a civil engineer is known by his failures, thousands will know him suddenly
1/27/23, 19:47 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you must have mistook me for someone else, my aura is almost invisible

1/27/23, 19:48 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Build a bridge with some defects and then fix it. You're famous and no lives lost
1/27/23, 19:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: in one the classes this week, professor went on a question that hypothetically anything can happen, for example what if sun disappears, people started giving their hypothesis, like we will launched from solar system etc
1/27/23, 19:49 - Amritanshu Raj CR: we will burst .... and so so
1/27/23, 19:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Nope, it was clearer than ever. It was you, no doubt about that
1/27/23, 19:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yup. That's a joke I doubt he would have dared to make in the US
1/27/23, 19:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i stood up in last and told i agree with all the points but chronologically the first and foremost thing that will happen is night, everyone bursted into laughter.
1/27/23, 19:51 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
1/27/23, 19:52 - Amritanshu Raj CR: even professor started laughing
1/27/23, 19:52 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Launching is physics. Implications can be more dire on if the earth will be ripped apart due to the sheer force or collide into something

1/27/23, 19:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Makes no sense to me
1/27/23, 19:55 - Amritanshu Raj CR: maybe i know the reason
1/27/23, 19:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Okay, there are many students but they will drop soon. Just wait for a few days
1/27/23, 19:55 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Tell me tell me
1/27/23, 19:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Keep up with your sense of humour. Just don't get killed
1/27/23, 19:56 - Amritanshu Raj CR: his student won best paper award recently in a conference in poland
1/27/23, 19:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's very inconvenient for some of us who have class till 1

1/27/23, 19:57 - Amritanshu Raj CR: they won't let it fix, if it works then no need to fix, they call engineer only after it collapses

2/11/23, 09:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Dear Students,

We are excited to announce that the Valentine’s Day event will take place in front of Manogatha at Nila Campus on February 12th, from 7.30 p.m. to 10 p.m.

The event promises to be a night filled with magic and romance, as the front of Manogatha will be lit up with lights, creating a magical atmosphere. We will also ensure that the music adds to the ambiance.

We have also arranged for letterboxes to be placed in the hostels, where you can drop in your love notes.

For those who are single and looking for love, we have a special treat in store. Fill out the Google form with your interests, and we will pair you up with the person who is most compatible with you. The reveal will take place at the event. The form will be sent soon.

Along with that, we’ll open the night with a bunch of games conducted by Campus Spotlight.

Additionally, we will be holding a Staring Contest, where partners will have to stare into each other's eyes, and the one who lasts the longest will be declared the winner.

The Prom Night segment will feature romantic melodies to set the mood, while the Single’s Party will feature hand-picked songs to keep everyone entertained.

Transport arrangements will be announced soon.

Wishing you all a Happy Valentine's Day!

Best regards,
The Valentine's Day Event Team

2/13/23, 00:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: Watching can involve exploitation,  since dunno actors
2/13/23, 00:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yesh

2/13/23, 00:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yesh yesh
2/13/23, 00:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: You talking about 50 shades?
2/13/23, 00:18 - Saamp🐍: Cause in movies you're limited by director's imagination
2/13/23, 00:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: True
2/13/23, 00:18 - Saamp🐍: In book it's limitless
2/13/23, 00:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: 50 shades claim to be BDSM. But the guy is just a creep
2/13/23, 00:18 - Saamp🐍: But if you're not so imaginative or lazy it'll be boring
2/13/23, 00:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yesh yesh
2/13/23, 00:19 - Saamp🐍: He had intimacy issues

2/13/23, 00:22 - Saamp🐍: When a guy watches romance
2/13/23, 00:22 - Saamp🐍: @919447744790 @919188011081
2/13/23, 00:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: I like it. But depends on girls
2/13/23, 00:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: I kinda think it makes a guy an inner romantic and maybe thoughtful?
2/13/23, 00:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
2/13/23, 00:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: Dunno
2/13/23, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Romance as in?
2/13/23, 00:23 - Saamp🐍: I've been pondering this question but opinion changes a lot
2/13/23, 00:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: Not porn ig
2/13/23, 00:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: <Media omitted>
2/13/23, 00:23 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
2/13/23, 00:23 - Saamp🐍: Every girl wants a sensitive guy or who's emotional
2/13/23, 00:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yesh yesh
2/13/23, 00:24 - Saamp🐍: But as soon as guy shows their emotional side or becomes sensitive
2/13/23, 00:24 - Saamp🐍: It becomes a turn off for girls
2/13/23, 00:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I want someone honest, truthful to themselves and me
2/13/23, 00:24 - Saamp🐍: Majorly
2/13/23, 00:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not for me
2/13/23, 00:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have many emotional men in my family
2/13/23, 00:25 - Saamp🐍: Interesting
2/13/23, 00:25 - Saamp🐍: One more point in my dataset
2/13/23, 00:25 - Saamp🐍: @919188011081 wouldn't you agree?
2/13/23, 00:25 - Lekshmi R Nair: Ig. Like maybe some of us think like men have to be strong, ones that ask us out, blah blah blah...
When I think that the other party is being too sensitive I try to think what will happen if I was in his shoes. Then I do try to understand
2/13/23, 00:25 - Saamp🐍: From your experience or ranting of other girls
2/13/23, 00:26 - Lekshmi R Nair: Most of my friends don't have boyfriends,  or just got them
2/13/23, 00:26 - Saamp🐍: Jdjshshs
2/13/23, 00:26 - Saamp🐍: So complicated
2/13/23, 00:27 - Saamp🐍: Idk how I reached ed Sheeran I started from kishor kumar
2/13/23, 00:27 - Lekshmi R Nair: Also it's like, I m with the guy cuz he is awesome and he is thoughtful and sweet. So how can ine side of that become let down
2/13/23, 00:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 😂
2/13/23, 00:27 - Saamp🐍: True that I think the observation which I'm talking about happens more before they are in a relationship
2/13/23, 00:27 - Lekshmi R Nair: If he wasn't sensitive,  he wouldn't be nice to me in other ways. So I shouldn't expect emotions only I wanna  see
2/13/23, 00:28 - Saamp🐍: 🤔🤔🤔
2/13/23, 00:28 - Lekshmi R Nair: Only emotions
2/13/23, 00:28 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yesss. I do think this is true
2/13/23, 00:28 - Saamp🐍: I should write a poem
2/13/23, 00:28 - Saamp🐍: 😂
2/13/23, 00:29 - Lekshmi R Nair: Before knowing their positive sides, if we just see negative or maybe weaker sides of emotions we will underestimate the guy
2/13/23, 00:30 - Lekshmi R Nair: Too much emotion can also be scary, since the other party may not have such strong emotions enough to care to consol3
2/13/23, 00:30 - Saamp🐍: Yeahhh
2/13/23, 00:30 - Saamp🐍: Love is just dumb luck
2/13/23, 00:30 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yesh

2/24/23, 19:02 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you can just code logic for or use anything else but it must five some output once there is input, we can add csv reading stuff later that's easier part
2/24/23, 19:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Securing a new room for my roommate
2/24/23, 19:03 - Amritanshu Raj CR: use of special powers i see

2/24/23, 19:05 - Saamp🐍: Sneha I think he wants to know your height
2/24/23, 19:06 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>

2/24/23, 19:07 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
2/24/23, 19:07 - Amritanshu Raj CR: the msg was 4'20

2/24/23, 19:07 - Amritanshu Raj CR: to make sense mathematically
2/24/23, 19:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Use metric
2/24/23, 19:08 - Saamp🐍: 🦴
2/24/23, 19:09 - Saamp🐍: Amritanshu have to pick a bone
2/24/23, 19:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: height of systematicism
2/24/23, 19:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Go to food court
2/24/23, 19:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Many bones
2/24/23, 19:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: nope, i will never let issues escalate this much
2/24/23, 19:11 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
2/24/23, 19:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: in our environmental engineering lab some lab technician had a cup of bone on his table as toothpicks
2/24/23, 19:12 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i took photo in order to send you guys but then forgot
2/24/23, 19:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: in your opinion is it ethical?
2/24/23, 19:14 - Amritanshu Raj CR: ?
2/24/23, 19:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: The bones of food he ate?
2/24/23, 19:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i call it height of uncompassionate behaviour
2/24/23, 19:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's disgusting if after food time
2/24/23, 19:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: Or random bones? It's weird ig?
2/24/23, 19:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: nope, it was dry, older
2/24/23, 19:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: Tf
2/24/23, 19:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: Is he creepy?
2/24/23, 19:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: 👀
2/24/23, 19:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: maybe he ate
2/24/23, 19:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: Who buys bones
2/24/23, 19:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: That's disgusting if old enough to dry🥲
2/24/23, 19:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: don't know didn't checked whose table it was
2/24/23, 19:17 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Real bones or art piece?
2/24/23, 19:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: But ig, on some hand it can be, like, not wasting trees
2/24/23, 19:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I haven't seen many bones, so can't say
2/24/23, 19:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: What if the animal is already slaughtered
2/24/23, 19:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: Then, we are maximizing the use
2/24/23, 19:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am just saying a side,I would personally find this eww
2/24/23, 19:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What are those bones for though?
2/24/23, 19:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: real ones, chicken eaters told perhaps chicken
2/24/23, 19:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Bones decay over time
2/24/23, 19:18 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Ohhh
2/24/23, 19:18 - Lekshmi R Nair: Like people use animal bones for fertilizer
2/24/23, 19:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Hyperrealistic art exists 🥲
2/24/23, 19:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Toothpick aaa
2/24/23, 19:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Germs
2/24/23, 19:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Microbes
2/24/23, 19:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
2/24/23, 19:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: I put my linkedIn open to work
2/24/23, 19:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: certainly not for those purposes, it was on his table i almost touched it but then saw something creepy
2/24/23, 19:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: Got a message from recruiter
2/24/23, 19:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: this is my guess
2/24/23, 19:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: Innuit
2/24/23, 19:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: I think you guys should try it
2/24/23, 19:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: I have nothing on my li kedIn
2/24/23, 19:20 - Lekshmi R Nair: No projects etc
2/24/23, 19:22 - Amritanshu Raj CR: not think it was, plus who buys bones as table .....
2/24/23, 19:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Omk
2/24/23, 19:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Tastes can different
2/24/23, 19:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I had to google to remember where I heard Lebensraum before
2/24/23, 19:54 - Amritanshu Raj CR: this much different taste, it is good to have freedom but still you must adhere some basic laws, you mustn't have your dinner residue bones openly being displayed on your workspace, it is not some t-rex skeleton in a museum
2/24/23, 19:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲 I agree
2/24/23, 19:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
2/24/23, 19:56 - Lekshmi R Nair: True
2/25/23, 09:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://youtube.com/shorts/m4lc_8GkjPk
Watch this
2/25/23, 09:46 - Saamp🐍: Good way to start a day
2/25/23, 11:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: nice, but why the hell a store would sell butterfly wings, if its artificial it's weight would make butterfly not fly and if it's natural 🥲
2/25/23, 11:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's a feather na
2/25/23, 11:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It'll be heavier than its original wing for sure
2/25/23, 11:08 - Amritanshu Raj CR: insects have wing right? words have feathers as smaller units making up wings
2/25/23, 11:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: *birds
2/25/23, 11:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yeah. The lady used a store bought bird feather as a prosthetic
2/25/23, 11:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: https://youtu.be/XAXwmMu8otM
2/25/23, 12:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: prosthetic is no help in nature, let the nature do its job, someone has to die for others to live
2/25/23, 12:00 - Amritanshu Raj CR: prosthetic is captivity
2/25/23, 12:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: someone has to die?
2/25/23, 12:09 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Did you not save a bat a while ago? Why did you do that?
2/25/23, 12:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If I accidentally tumble down and fall, will nobody come to help me? Leave my parents, they will do it. But will some stranger not come to help me?
2/25/23, 12:16 - Amritanshu Raj CR: adding prosthetic is never solution, it's altering how nature works, it risks the population of that species as weaker members may pass their genes leading to added uncertainty of mutations, it maybe be a good kind act but then it risks the population due to natural selection being altered
2/25/23, 12:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: https://youtube.com/shorts/UoQQ5xX2kJQ?feature=share
This lady is awesome
2/25/23, 12:17 - Amritanshu Raj CR: i just picked it up and released, it got trapped in my house, i didn't gave him food or water, it was natural, i didn't altered natural selection
2/25/23, 12:18 - Amritanshu Raj CR: you are taking the debate in an obviously very different direction, i have deep respect for all the species but somewhere you have to draw line between humans and others
2/25/23, 12:20 - Amritanshu Raj CR: noice, i liked the idea
2/25/23, 12:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I understand your point. But in a sufficiently large population the risks aren't that high
2/25/23, 12:24 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Hmmm
2/25/23, 12:25 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Then instinctively we are considering that humans are different
2/25/23, 12:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: While I agree that a line has to be drawn, to decide if to save or not to save is not easy
2/25/23, 12:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I won't say more since I'm yet to read studies which can quantify human impact on natural selection
2/25/23, 12:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It would be wrong of me to keep spitting opinions as facts 😬
2/25/23, 12:30 - Amritanshu Raj CR: populations of these insects may not be very well integrated, localised population grps due to disruption in their ways (migratory and others) especially due to human settlements is the issue, they have to survive their encounters with humans, you know just using the lights in night kills millions of insects daily, how will you help em, it is time we accept that we can't take responsibility for what we are doing with them, let em learn
2/25/23, 12:31 - Amritanshu Raj CR: *millions: billions
2/25/23, 12:33 - Amritanshu Raj CR: obviously we are, no other species is responsible for the eradicating as many species as we did, no other species is danger to their own existence, no other species has a inbuilt computational power as strong as we have, we need to try for an balance between what right we can be do and what wrong we do
2/25/23, 12:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Of course we can't save all of them. But I don't see why a random act of kindness for an individual should be a huge cause of concern
2/25/23, 12:34 - Amritanshu Raj CR: if you wanna keep it capitive you must save but then what purpose is of it's existence
2/25/23, 12:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: a showpiece?
2/25/23, 12:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Every plan should involve rescue, rehabilitation and release. Otherwise it's not a good plan
2/25/23, 12:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I agree
2/25/23, 12:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: it's never wrong to express opinions as long as you have ability to listen other's onion with the same enthusiasm and energy with which you express yours
2/25/23, 12:38 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I know, but I don't like to speak about things I don't know a lot about
2/25/23, 12:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: do you think she had one such plan, she will shoot more videos in my opinion
2/25/23, 12:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: have you seen those east asians making pools in forests and what it do with ecosystem
2/25/23, 12:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I hope she had a release plan and I feel that butterfly can be released. There are experts who have more knowledge on the matter on if the animal should be saved, treated, released etc. But not everyone has access to that information 🥲
2/25/23, 12:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No I haven't
2/25/23, 12:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Wow
2/25/23, 12:43 - Amritanshu Raj CR: https://youtu.be/YCyLWhPnq1M
2/25/23, 12:44 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I should mention this too. Dodo has associations with Peta and they promote cuteness in odd pairs of animals (predator and prey). Which is misinforming the viewers
2/25/23, 12:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is ridiculous
2/25/23, 14:49 - Sneha Doubt Solver: https://www.instagram.com/p/CpFDja7LSF4/
2/25/23, 14:50 - Sneha Doubt Solver: For me it was my father
2/25/23, 14:56 - Saamp🐍: I'm hungry 🥲
2/25/23, 14:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have grapes
2/25/23, 14:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Lekshmi has fruits
2/25/23, 14:57 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I have fruit bread
2/25/23, 14:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My umbrella died today
2/25/23, 14:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It lived a short life
2/25/23, 14:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 1 year
2/25/23, 14:59 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 1.5 actually
2/25/23, 15:00 - Saamp🐍: 🥲🥲🥲
2/25/23, 15:00 - Saamp🐍: I have no will
2/25/23, 15:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Where there are grapes, there is will
2/25/23, 15:01 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Give birth to will
2/25/23, 15:10 - Sneha Doubt Solver: My parents are coming next Saturday
2/25/23, 15:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: With umbrella
2/25/23, 15:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: Bring fruits
2/25/23, 15:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
2/25/23, 15:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Yes
2/25/23, 15:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What all do you want
2/25/23, 15:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They'll anyway bring bananas, apples, oranges and grapes
2/25/23, 15:12 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Should I ask them to bring a 4kg watermelon for you?
2/25/23, 15:57 - Saamp🐍: Just ate maggi
2/25/23, 15:57 - Saamp🐍: Now livable
2/25/23, 15:57 - Saamp🐍: 🥲🥲
2/25/23, 15:59 - Saamp🐍: Also sneha where did you guys go
2/25/23, 16:00 - Saamp🐍: Yukta's status
2/25/23, 16:00 - Saamp🐍: I'm curious 😶‍🌫️
2/25/23, 17:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Great 😌
2/25/23, 17:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: We had to go but didn't 😂
2/25/23, 17:21 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This message was deleted
2/25/23, 17:58 - Saamp🐍: 😂
2/25/23, 19:32 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I ordered umbrella
2/25/23, 19:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Parents won't come 🥲
2/25/23, 19:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They may come. But I need more reasons
2/25/23, 19:33 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
2/25/23, 19:58 - Lekshmi R Nair: Whyyyyy
2/25/23, 19:58 - Lekshmi R Nair: U miss them
2/25/23, 19:59 - Lekshmi R Nair: And exams over
2/25/23, 20:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They may come
2/25/23, 20:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Maybe after 2 weeks
2/25/23, 20:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Father only I guess
2/25/23, 20:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I don't think my mother is here now. I haven't talked to her in days
2/25/23, 20:04 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Last time I talked to her was last Sunday 🥲
2/25/23, 20:10 - Lekshmi R Nair: Y
2/25/23, 20:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Don't know. They try not to 'waste' my time
2/25/23, 20:14 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's impossible to talk to them for over 2min at this point
2/25/23, 20:15 - Saamp🐍: Mine is complete opposite 😂
2/25/23, 20:15 - Saamp🐍: They be like padhai to hoti rahegi ye bata khaya kya 😂
2/25/23, 20:26 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That's sweet ❤️
2/25/23, 20:27 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I've grown very distant from them after coming to college
2/25/23, 20:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Heck they didn't tell me that my father left work 🥲
2/25/23, 20:29 - Sneha Doubt Solver: <Media omitted>
2/25/23, 20:29 - Saamp🐍: Happens
2/25/23, 20:29 - Saamp🐍: We don't realise
2/25/23, 20:30 - Saamp🐍: But once we leave hometown for studies
2/25/23, 20:30 - Saamp🐍: That's it...
2/25/23, 20:30 - Saamp🐍: 🥲🥲
2/25/23, 20:30 - Saamp🐍: Then we go home just to visit
2/25/23, 20:30 - Saamp🐍: Not to stay
2/25/23, 20:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'll live with my parents in the future 😬
2/25/23, 20:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🥲🥲🥲
2/25/23, 20:31 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yess
2/25/23, 20:31 - Lekshmi R Nair: You really need to talk to ur parents

Most of the time it goes in the studying and I don't miss it but there are times in day while doing small small things which makes me remind of you guys.... Like how mother used to scold me when I leave clothes everywhere and all... Talking to you guys helps me fill that void

2/25/23, 20:42 - Lekshmi R Nair: Awww🥺🥺🥺

2/26/23, 15:19 - Amritanshu Raj CR: This story: on tiger hunting, in she was blackmailed to give money because it died of sound and not of bullet right?
2/26/23, 15:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: But Bhavan's was love

2/26/23, 15:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: That school doesn't even have a proper ground 🥲
2/26/23, 15:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Awwww

2/26/23, 15:30 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Damage control
2/26/23, 15:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Not really. Students were mean. Circumstances turned me into this

2/26/23, 15:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>
2/26/23, 15:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In my village there are many govt and aided schools. They need to maintain a student teacher ratio. If too many teachers per student they will transfer teachers
2/26/23, 15:35 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Maybe alliance 😂
2/26/23, 15:35 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Teachers don't want that. So before or even during the school year teachers go to houses and bribe parents to send their wards to their school
2/26/23, 15:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I had that option, but didn't
2/26/23, 15:36 - Amritanshu Raj CR: <Media omitted>

2/26/23, 15:38 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Oh, you could have been astronaut but your choices
2/26/23, 15:40 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's very rampant. Some people change schools every few months. I see them in different uniforms every time I return home. Basically parents don't care what they're and if they're learning anything. Neither do the teachers. These schools had very poor turnout in online classes. They had 100s of excuses. 
All schools aren't like this. But there are 3-4 in my area only. All of them Govt. Aided
2/26/23, 15:40 - Amritanshu Raj CR: My lord, emotional card khela jaa rha hai, I agree but then there are people who are good you could have find em
2/26/23, 15:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It was a joke on the darker side. Leave it 😶‍🌫

3/11/23, 10:09 - Amritanshu Raj CR: I am built harshly, i'm cld from inside out i'm the villian this society needs but doesn't deserve
3/11/23, 10:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: Student secruon
3/11/23, 10:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: Section
3/11/23, 10:09 - Lekshmi R Nair: So why should I?
3/11/23, 10:10 - Amritanshu Raj CR: After that, you mustn't adhere the laws of restraint and be openly reciprocal to him
3/11/23, 10:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: I had to mail for bigdata, because crs didn't ask. Sir took it as my personal issue
3/11/23, 10:11 - Sneha Doubt Solver: I'm mailing now

3/11/23, 10:11 - Lekshmi R Nair: OK.
3/11/23, 10:13 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Only one thing college and students(pors) are messed up not much can be done
3/11/23, 10:14 - Saamp🐍: Okay what I'm about to say is my opinion take it with a pinch of salt....


I get that you're pissed for CR not working properly.... But given that she didn't become CR by choice you can't blame or force her to do things right... There's no one who's willing to become CR we'll be CRless. 2 things can be done one she can resign which I think is she even wanna do... Other is if she's not taking responsibility someone should right. So better candidate comes forward and becomes CR for example you. Just blaming it on her isn't right. It's like blaming that drainage is really bad from the outside but no one wants to get down and clean it.
3/11/23, 10:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: I am not blaming her. I am saying if you Don wanna be then don't be
3/11/23, 10:15 - Saamp🐍: Now me zip
3/11/23, 10:15 - Saamp🐍: Me scared
3/11/23, 10:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: I should have to stand up because I don't like the current thing
3/11/23, 10:15 - Saamp🐍: Yeahh cause knowing her nature I think she'll be stressed too much about it 😂
3/11/23, 10:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's like, if you criticize, you have to be the leader
3/11/23, 10:15 - Lekshmi R Nair: Which is a dumb logic
3/11/23, 10:16 - Saamp🐍: It kinda is 😂
3/11/23, 10:16 - Saamp🐍: Since no one else is taking responsibility
3/11/23, 10:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: I said this much because she is what can you do
3/11/23, 10:16 - Saamp🐍: If someone willingly stand and then don't do anything then you can blame
3/11/23, 10:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: Let them resign then
3/11/23, 10:16 - Lekshmi R Nair: Not mailing is willingness
3/11/23, 10:16 - Saamp🐍: 😂😂
3/11/23, 10:16 - Saamp🐍: Ok baba
3/11/23, 10:17 - Lekshmi R Nair: Not really 😂

3/11/23, 10:23 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Now but also if she raises her voice it May benefit her also, plus since she has got power to communicate she should use it because not using it is also not beneficial to anyone
3/11/23, 10:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: I would like the argue about her choice part. I have raised it before. In this group itself I believe. Before this fiasco
3/11/23, 10:24 - Lekshmi R Nair: But yes. I wouldn't be this harsh of this wasn't @919447744790 . I expected her to care and be reasonable

3/11/23, 18:34 - Lekshmi R Nair: My lack of trust is due to lack of concern he has shown
3/11/23, 18:34 - Lekshmi R Nair: When I told about water issue, he told me that we are privileged
3/11/23, 18:34 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Apathy can live in groups 🥲

3/11/23, 18:36 - Lekshmi R Nair: That talk was unnecessary
3/11/23, 18:36 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They'll say I'm privileged and I could afford treatment
3/11/23, 18:36 - Lekshmi R Nair: Yes we are privileged but it's irrelevant in the context of us not getting proper food
3/11/23, 18:37 - Amritanshu Raj CR: Anyway you will reincarnate, shouldn't complain about health better focus on karma
3/11/23, 18:37 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Indeed. I need a setup to combust Hydrogen, le Hindenburg

3/15/23, 12:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: It's official
3/15/23, 12:19 - Lekshmi R Nair: Sujit is not a nice person
3/15/23, 12:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Enable the techno-cultural fest of IIT Palakkad, Petrichor, to operate to its maximum
potential by inspecting the various related documentation and providing the core team
the support it requires over the organizational and operational phases.
3/15/23, 12:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: What's this documentation?
3/15/23, 12:19 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Koi batao mujhe

3/15/23, 12:22 - Lekshmi R Nair: Sujit has done 0 stuff, he was asked to see what he would do about batch split, no specific answers
3/15/23, 12:22 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In the end of last MTC, Dean clearly said batch split can't be avoided and nobody spoke a word against him
3/15/23, 12:23 - Lekshmi R Nair: "I will so it" is kinda nor an answer

3/15/23, 12:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So they can show it to potential sponsors for footfall estimates
3/15/23, 12:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Similarly, they’ll have their overall budget, every events budget and expenditure reports as well
3/15/23, 12:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: They’ll have information about whether they broke even or not, the issues they faced when they tried to get approvals for their events, what on site logistics were required etc
3/15/23, 12:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: All of this info is mostly documented so the future fest teams have a reference
3/15/23, 12:31 - Sneha Doubt Solver: So this data is what im referring to

3/15/23, 12:56 - Sneha Doubt Solver: If Kartik loses then does he have the qualifications to apply for tech sec?

3/16/23, 17:28 - Sneha Doubt Solver: It's putting you in a uncomfortable situation that you can't say no

BTW it's unlikely I will get after this point. But..  I wrote an article
3/17/23, 18:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He is giving dumb arguments to substantiate his point
3/17/23, 18:02 - Lekshmi R Nair: What point? The shades?
3/17/23, 18:02 - Sneha Doubt Solver: And I can't even speak against him because he controls my marks
3/17/23, 18:03 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He told me 10 times to mail 5 test cases with eval policy
3/17/23, 18:03 - Lekshmi R Nair: Means

3/17/23, 18:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He is into the JEE system
3/17/23, 18:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: No transparency
3/17/23, 18:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: In the end he also told us let his daughter cry
3/17/23, 18:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He'll be late
3/17/23, 18:05 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He'll drive fast and something may happen to him
3/17/23, 18:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Like he is directly blaming me for that
3/17/23, 18:06 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Since 5:45 I've been telling him to leave since he'll be late

3/17/23, 18:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: This is damn frustrating
3/17/23, 18:07 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Backing yourself on emotional grounds and not having points of substance
3/17/23, 18:08 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Even if he does have points he is not conveying them right

3/18/23, 22:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: Joel is bringing it up again, but masking it to be non offensive
3/18/23, 22:13 - Sneha Doubt Solver: He could have worded the question differently

3/19/23, 20:41 - Sneha Doubt Solver: 🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️ 🌧️

                *from today*
                *Until 30/03/2023*
                 *very cold...*

  Remember: Starting tomorrow at 05:27, we will experience the APHELION event.  Earth is at a different distance from the Sun than normal.

 We cannot see this event, but we can feel its impact.  It will last till March.

  We may experience colder weather than usual.

  It can cause fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.
   We should strengthen our immune system by consuming foods that strengthen the lungs and heart.

  The distance from Earth to Sun is 5 light minutes ie 90,000,000km.  Aphelion event takes us 152,000,000  km from the Sun or 66% of the distance.

 Therefore the humidity in the air will increase till the end of March instead of ending in the current month of February due to the south-west monsoon from last July. 
Our body... especially those who feel difficulty in breathing,,
 Older people.. will see a big difference with this coolness.
So we have to keep our health balanced, whether it's cloudy or sunny, the body still feels cold!!!
And winter can cause feelings of lethargy even in healthy people.
Therefore, appropriate changes should be made from the way you dress to the food you eat.
  
 To protect our health... Please share this information with everyone as possible especially family friends who are elderly.  So they might as well be forewarned.
